       "'\"Is this a good coffee maker?\" Well, that\\'s going to depend upon your expectations in coffee.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a \"pod coffee maker\" that makes normal drip coffee (think Keurig) then Nespresso is somewhat different, and may or may not meet your expectations.\\n\\nI also have a Keurig. It\\'s just fine for brewing basic, cheap coffee (or more expensive if you buy major-brand-name capsules). I like my Keurig--we\\'ve had it for over 5 years, and it works great. But, those who are environmentally conscious will soon realize that Keurig is not recyclable at all, and countless billions of pods a year are making their way into landfills.\\n\\nNespresso\\'s pods are made of 100% recycled/recyclable aluminum. Nespresso is VERY focused on a goal of 100% recycle-ability, and provides recycling bags with fully pre-paid shipping. Fill the bag (holds about 75-100 capsules), seal it, and drop it off at your nearest UPS store (or Nespresso store/kiosk if you happen to have one in a mall nearby). Nespresso will dismantle the pods, collect all the used grounds and process it into compost for landscaping use, and then melt down the pods and recycle them. 100% recycled!\\n\\nAll those recycling costs are already built in to the pod cost, so while these pods are more expensive than Keurig, there is ZERO waste as long as the consumer does their job.\\n\\nThe best way I can describe Nespresso is it\\'s a totally new coffee \"experience.\" Espresso or \"foo foo coffee\" lovers will likely be very pleased with this machine line. Folks who aren\\'t impressed with anything beyond a drip cup may find Nespresso a little \"snooty\" for them.\\n\\nNespresso\\'s Vertuo product produces coffee that is much more similar to a cup of espresso. The pods are spun at variable RPM\\'s (typically 3000 - 7000RPM) and use \"centrifusion\" - a made up word intended to commingle \"centrifugal force\" and \"infusion\". Basically, they spin the pod, a pump squirts in water, and the spinning forces produce the coffee which is extracted and drips into the cup. It\\'s not particularly noisy for a kitchen appliance, but you can definitely hear the spinning. Regardless of pod, they all come out with a layer of crema (coffee foam). There are (at the moment) five \"sizes\" of pods, which produce 1.5oz (espresso) up through 14 oz (\"Alto XL\").\\n\\nAs with any product line, there are pros and cons. There are some fantastic things about Vertuo and a few limitations.\\n\\nPros: Absolutely fantastic coffee. All cups have a crema layer on them, and there are a relatively plentiful number of flavors and intensities available, ranging from lighter and fruitier/acidic flavors all the way up to very dark bold and smoky options. There are seasonal special pods as well, such as holiday blends or single-origin \"master\" type coffees. Pods and contents are 100% recyclable. Easy to use out of the box--there\\'s ONE button. You press it. It works. Milk frother (optional add-on, included in our purchase) is FANTASTIC. I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but I use it with every cup! It\\'s easy to use, and creates that \"latte experience\"--it makes better lattes\\' than a certain really large chain whose name ends with \"bucks\"--yeah, you\\'ll spend \\'em there. Pod cost, compared to an espresso shop brewing an equivalent latte for you, is cheap. VERY tightly-integrated recycling: drop pods in bag. Bag full? Seal it and drop it off at your UPS store. Pre-paid return shipping means zero-extra cost. Done. Milk frother is VERY easy to clean--takes about 15 seconds, if that. I\\'ve only owned the machine for a month, but the build and overall experience lends itself to belief this is a very high-quality unit. Excellent app (iOS/Android)---you can view/order/manage pods, accessories, maintenance/cleaning products and subscriptions right from your phone/tablet. Love a particular flavor? Just add it to your cart. It even supports automatic/routine replenishment if you want that. Seasonal and other specials show up in the app when available, making the app a one-stop-shop. Company is VERY plugged in environmentally and has created a coffee experience that doesn\\'t fill a landfill. If you actually play the game the way Nespresso intends, it\\'s a holistic coffee experience and a great one at that.\\n\\nCons: No third-party pods, and pods are relatively expensive when compared to other \"pod\" brewing standards. You want this machine? You\\'ll be buying Nespresso-branded pods from Nespresso, or authorized resellers, and at full-tilt retail which typically runs about $0.90 for an Espresso pod and up to $1.20 for their normal coffees (some origins are as high as $2.00 a pod). So each cup is roughly double the cost of a Keurig brew. There are about 20 different pod flavors and five sizes available, so most people will find SOMETHING they like, but if you don\\'t love one of the 20, you\\'re out of luck as there are no 3rd-party options without \"hacking together\" a used pod, some self-ground coffee, and some foil cap stickers you found on the Internet.\\n\\nOverall, this is an EXCELLENT machine for those who want more than a pod of coffee. I\\'ve owned it for a month and I\\'m 100% hooked.'"

I\\'ve owned it for a month and I\\'m 100% hooked.We have used this machine daily since purchase 3 months ago and love it. I can back to write a review because of the quality of Nespresso customer service. The machine didn’t brew today and I called the support line after trying the online troubleshooting tips without success. My call was answered by a live, pleasant and helpful person after two rings! She used a one way video call to see the machine and walked me through a few different steps that fixed the issue. So refreshing!The inside box that the machine came in had been damaged, but the machine was not damaged. No where was I in formed that the machine came in a damaged box - should have been informed, before purchasing.I’m loving this machine! I’ve had many different ones, I’m currently away at work and can’t use my Jura. This little thing is amazing for the price! And the milk frother I love so much! Got it with the milk frother and 12 capsules! It’s also Bluetooth (still gotta figure that out) ! I recommend this product!This is the best purchase! My fiancé and I use this every single day. The machine is easy to use and the espresso pods are delicious. We used to get Starbucks every morning and we’ve saved so much money now that we use this machine. We make an iced caramel macchiato and it’s tastes better than Starbucks in our option. I’ve convinced both of my sisters to buy one and they love it as well! Would definitely recommend.I love this product. I used to go to Starbucks at least three times a day BUT these days I go maybe two to three times a week SINCE I GOT THIS MACHINE.Channel your inner barista with this!! So many options, easy to use and affordable when comparing costs to Starbs or Dunkin! Get one!! You need it!!!Espresso as good as it gets. Don’t know what “blending power” means, but the machine itself blends in nicely with the decor of my book shelves of 17th manuscripts.\\n\\nAnd yes, it is quite easy to use if one has water and electricity handy, and the flavor, as suggested above, is nonpareil.Love yourself enough to go ahead and upgrade!I really love this machine. It’s a beautiful red! Quiet when the coffee is being made. I’ll never go back to KuregSo much better than a K-Cup. Only thing that stinks is I couldn\\'t find it in stores, had to get it off Amazon. All the stars only have the new pod size (it\\'s something with a \"V\"), and I wanted the classic style.\\n\\nWorks great. Produces strong tasting espresso, and the pods are recyclable. What\\'s not to like?Moved to keurig not for the convenience but for the environmental impact. As long as the cups are recycled, it uses less energy and less water than the drip and bunn machines. That said, i had sacrificed a good cup of coffee for this. Then i was gifted a KCafe which includes the frother, and options opened up, but the coffee remained so so.\\n\\nSo, then a friend tells me about this beauty!! OMG!! Not only does it brew a strong, delicious cup of real coffee, the pods are fully recyclable- through the company. The machine has a lovely form factor, and is a pleasure to use!! It’s quiet, and quick. I’m no fan of Starbucks burnt coffee, i prefer my coffee tasty, and this was surprisingly smooth, nutty, and delicious.\\n\\nAlso, when you go to the website, there is a nice selection of flavors to choose from. And yes, you can get hot water from it (press the button three times). Would I recommend? Heck yeah.\\n\\nHappy camper, trying to convince myself that a cup of coffee at 11pm is cool, lol.\\n\\n7/22- just wanted to add! My aerocinno3 suddenly stopped frothing my milk this week, after months of working beautifully. I called Nespresso, and not only to I learn about my machine, but i also learned that sometimes a bad carton milk will cause issues. Here i am cursing the machine, reading all the negative reviews and then as soon as I swap to a new jug of milk... It\\'s working it\\'s magic again! I just wanted to stop by and encourage anyone who\\'s skeptical- take a moment to do some digging, this machine is awesome and the support at the company is superb! Still a happy camper!Get this Nespresso machine with a separate milk warmer/frother for convince. The machine does all the work and it takes great. Super easy to use (just like a keurig), comes with samples and a coupon for $10 off their website of course. There are 3 different size pods/cups (espresso, double espresso and coffee), and the machine detects that and makes it with the correct amount of water. The pods are not too bad. Range from $10-$20 for a pack of 10 pods on their website. Perfect for an espresso martini too!So far this has exceeded expectations! No more $7 coffee at Starbucks -- I like this far better and saving a ton over the long-term.I bought this with skepticism. I was used to toying with the wands on expensive espresso machines, struggling to make froth. But my skepticism was misplaced. This simple device is a breeze and the quality of the froth it makes it simply superb: Pour in milk (I\\'ve even used goat milk), press the button and a minute later the Vertuo has made a cup of froth that would please the best barista. An easy 5 stars.This machine blends and froths as well as our expensive gourmet machine. Impressed. Great addition to our office.This has been the best Amazon purchase by far! I cannot get those my week without this nespresso machine. Works perfectly and is so easy to use.Husband thanks me daily for his Nespresso!The machine makes a great cup of coffee but sometimes I want a little less or more water in my coffee. This is a one button machine and you get what the machine reads on the barcode of the pod. I love it but I need to keep my other machine for when I want something different..I am not a frequent coffee drinker but this machine has totally converted me (and the coffee, which is delicious). I recycle the capsules and I compost the coffee. The Aeroccino is an absolute must. I have now tried many types of coffee. I have found those I’ve preferred but even those I haven’t have been excellent, just too strong for my taste. I LOVE the guide describing the intensity and other descriptors of the coffees, and they are on the mark. One critical comment: please consider shipping coffee in an unmarked box! I’m grateful no one took my box from my stoop while I was at work considering NESPRESSO was prominently displayed on the box.We use it daily! Coffee/espresso is delicious. Super easy to get my daily espresso1st experienced the Nespresso Expresso’s while working in Middle East. Little did I know they originated from USA Nestle brands! I’m on my 2nd machine & still love it! This one provides both regular coffees as well as expressos!Our last Vertuo died and we needed a replacement. We didn\\'t realize how much the technology had been upgraded since we had first started using our original model.\\nThis design is VERY sleek and modern. I love that it opens and closes with basically no effort. I love that the tank can be positioned in a variety of ways.\\nWe love our Vertuo and highly recommend it!Works great!I understand that this item was previously used, but nonetheless, I feel like it arrived in pristine cosmetic and working condition! I don\\'t want to mislead anyone, because I\\'m sure each item is a little bit different, as far as wear and tear goes, but I am very impressed with this seller, so far! And if there are any changes, I will be sure to make an update.Makes the most wonderful cups of coffee and espresso ever. I regret not splurging and buying this package earlier. Loved the sample pack that came with it also to try lots of different variety. If you’re on the fence about buying it, don’t be, you won’t regret it!My wife is a coffee addict so I decided to purchased this for her birthday and she absolutely loves it! In addition to the quality of the machine construction, it is easy to use. Brewing time is about 2 minutes. She also loves the variety of nespresso pods it came with. Definitely worth it.El café es riquísimo. Y la cafetera súper fácil y práctica. Me encantaBest flavors ever. Nice varieties! It’s nice to getting the samples, they really are different, it’s hard to know and recall the variety though. It’s like a box of chocolates, you can’t always tell what’s inside!!This isn’t one of those confusing machines with knobs and gauges. You toss a pod in and press the button. It’s quiet and makes good espresso and coffee. I’ve wanted one for years. Zero regret!So far I have had this baby for a few weeks and I’m obsessed. So convenient and I love that they can be recycledWe had been living with our old one cup brew that splattered everywhere until we finally decided to take the plunge into the Nespresso world, and boy are we glad we did. The Verturo is great! It scans the top of the capsule to determine which of the three sizes, and what parameters to use. The result is the perfect cup of expresso, cappuccino, or Americana, whatever your heart desires. The warmer/froth machine that came with it is exactly as amazing. The only downside is, the capsules are really expensive. If you compare it to going out to Starbucks everyday, it’s much cheaper of course. Other than that, highly recommend it!This is amazing coffee maker. In the morning people come to my house just to get a cup of coffee before work.Great quality at a quarter of the store costWe took this on a camping trip and afterward decided we don’t need to go to Starbucks anymore. This baby makes delicious coffee!I bought this coffer maker as a gift and it has been very well received. Much better taste profile than other pod coffee makers. The Nespresso leaves no plastic flavor, the pods are aluminum, and it\\'s very easy to use.Easy to use. Just wish the pods were more accessible in retail storesI\\'ve had these products for three months and used them every morning -- I LOVE not going to S----ucks anymore! I have had nothing but great results and have not one negative comment about them... I read reviews that said the frother didn\\'t make enough noise so he didn\\'t know it was done - it has a light that goes on when you push the button to start it, and it goes off when it\\' s done. I find that the timing of making the coffee and milk frothing is almost exactly the same (open the unit, put new pod in, close unit and as it warms up to start, put milk in frother and the maker is then ready to go - start them both and they finish about the same time. I find that low fat milks froth just fine despite what other reviews have said (I use 1% most of the time). LOVE that it senses the \"size\" of the coffee/espresso pods and brews with the appropriate amount of water (you don\\'t have to push a button to choose a size - but you can push the start button again if you want to dilute it). LOVE that the pods are recyclable and that the company provides postage free collection bags for that. LOVE the variety of coffees and espressos available (even by the mermaid brand), and last but not least, I get to think of George Clooney every morning as I make my coffee/espresso! P.S. I recently bought the \"Double Wall Glass Coffee mugs, (4-Pcak) 12 Ounces-Clear Glass Coffee Cups\" so I could see how beautiful the drinks were as they are made, making the \"event\" each morning even more enjoyable!I was very interested in purchasing a single cup coffee machine and I knew I didn\\'t want a Keurig because that would basically be like drinking out of a toilet. I did first purchasing a Nespresso Vertuo Plus only to be having grounds in my cup and it throwing error codes within a month of having it so I sent it back. I then purchased the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and haven\\'t looked back. I am very pleased with the quality of coffee it produces. I even refill my own pods and I am amazed at how the coffee still tastes so good! I did a taste test comparison using the same coffee in a regular coffee pot vs the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and it does make a difference! Nespresso brews a less bitter coffee! I also love the Aeroccino, I use it daily and I love that you can do a hot or cold foam. I recommend it to anyone looking for a single serve coffee machine. It is 100% worth it!I was a barista for 3 years and am extremely picky about coffee. I did a lot of research and finally landed on this the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and I have to say this might have been the best purchase I have ever made! I needed something that would satisfy my \"boujee\" coffee lifestyle but still give my partner the ability to have his lam..... I mean normal coffee. The price of the pods, milk, and syrups are nothing in comparison to paying $5-7 for one latte 2-3 times a day.\\n\\nLet me break it down (If you drink lattes every day):\\n- $3-5 for a gallon of lactose free milk that last me a week and a half or so\\n- $3-5 for vanilla syrup\\n- $1.5-3 for caramel or chocolate syrup (You don\\'t need to get the high end stuff. I promise it almost all taste the same at the end of the day. You\\'re just paying for the brand.)\\n- $0.87 for the pod depending on the one you get and if you get them in bulk (That can be recycled!)\\n- Reusable cups/straws\\n- No gas\\n- No waiting in lines\\n\\nSeriously people. The hardest thing you\\'ll have to do with all of this is find out what your favorite coffee roast is. And they even make that easy by providing you a sample box with like 12ish (can\\'t remember off the top of my head) pods to try! My favorite is the small gold one. It\\'s similar to the the Starbucks blonde espresso (which you can also buy pods of!)\\n\\nOther perks:\\n- Super easy to clean\\n- Really easy to refill\\n\\nBuy it. That\\'s it. Just do it.This is coffee on another level! Every cup is brewed consistently, coffee or espresso or double shot. These are amazingly fresh and sealed so that the coffee tastes way better than K-cups from Petes or Starbucks. The machine is fast and even discards the pods into a container so it doesn\\'t stand around all day, with the taste of the old and used grounds going into your next cup. The coffee will be a bit pricier and you will have to reorder from their website. It will average around $1.00-1.30 per coffee or espresso. But to be honest, to get this quality of coffee this fast right at your place is well worh it. I\\'ve had world famous coffee for example in Colombia, and their stuff is pretty close, obviously not as if you\\'re there but the taste is surprisingly good. Can\\'t go back to K-pods, ever. Even beats Starbucks fresh brewed, half the price.This is the best coffee maker ever, coffee pods are spendy, but it’s well worth it!! Just put your pod in and the maker does the rest even making it frothed for ya!! 😇🤘🏼5 stars!!I’m loving it! Definitely worth the money and lives up to the hype.Bought it for my 19 year old daughter and she loves it is all I got from her. Looks like good quality though.....\\n\\nSorry I can\\'t give much more information 😔UPDATE: I went for a Keurig K-Supreme Plus instead and it\\'s one of the best things I\\'ve ever purchased! I am absolutely in love with it (and I don\\'t usually get so enthusiastic about things that I\\'ve purchased)! Delicious coffee within seconds every morning – it actually makes me look forward to morning time, and so much variety!! It probably sounds like I\\'m affiliated with Keurig but I\\'m not, and I\\'m not being paid for this review. I just don\\'t understand why Nespresso has such a following (I had tried this out because a friend told me that it\\'s waaay better than Keurig, and that is definitely not true).\\n\\nHigh-level faults before getting into the fraud/scam details:\\n1. It is very difficult to use. I work in tech, and love tech gadgets. With this thing, it\\'s ridiculously difficult to figure out how to make a cup of coffee. I had to watch numerous YouTube videos. The amount of different combinations of button presses for each different function is just crazy. For example \"tap the coffee button three times within 2 seconds, hold two buttons for more than 3 seconds, then tap the coffee button to confirm. Then a green light will flash three times, followed by a solid orange light...\". I can pretty much guarantee you won\\'t even be able to open the machine to put a pod in there without watching a YouTube video.\\n2. There is a VERY limited selection of coffees. While every coffee company out there makes pods for Keurig machines, Nespresso machines read a barcode on each pod, and will not do anything unless the pod is from Nespresso or Starbucks.\\n3. The coffee is just meh. I don\\'t know what all the great reviews are about.\\n\\nNow for the fraud part – seriously, there\\'s a whole reddit thread about suing Nespresso for this:\\n\\nI received my Nespresso Vertuo Plus today and was very disappointed to find out (after a lot of frustrating, time-wasting troubleshooting and researching) that the largest coffee it can make is 7.7oz, even though Nespresso says this machine can make up to 14oz coffees. However, Nespresso has discontinued the Alto/XL pods that are required to make 14oz coffees, but they still say everywhere that they can make up to 14oz. The whole reason I decided to give Nespresso a try is because they very loudly market the fact that this can make large cups of coffee (like a Keurig can), but it\\'s literally not possible in this machine because when it reads a barcode on each pod, it uses the amount of water that\\'s recommended for that pod. So, without the Alto/XL pods (which no longer exist, but you won\\'t see that update in any of their documentation or YouTube videos), you cannot make a coffee that\\'s larger than 7.7oz unless you use multiple pods, which would be stupid because the pods are already more expensive than their competitors. Nespresso even has a YouTube video that shows how to make a large cup of coffee in this machine by manually programming the amount of water to use. I tried this with one of the other pods (not Alto/XL), and even though I kept my finger on the button like they said, it still stopped at 7.7oz. They should clearly say that you can only make a maximum of 7.7oz because they no longer support the 14oz pods.\\n\\nFinal thoughts:\\nI\\'m originally from Europe but I\\'ve lived in the US for a few years. When I go into a coffee shop in the US, it\\'s most common to see people ordering at least 12oz or 16oz coffees. Tiny little coffees are great in Europe, but Nespresso is being really stupid for making the majority of their machines not cater for the US market, which is one of the biggest markets in the world for coffee consumption. I was eyeing this thing for weeks, couldn’t decide if I needed it or not as I already have a Kuerig in good condition. I am SO happy I got it. I look forward to my coffee every day. This machine is perfect, I purchased the bundle on prime day that came with the aerochino and honestly, the coffee is already so frothy and creamy, you really don’t need the milk frother. Very happy with my purchase. ☺️This is probably the best espresso maker you can buy. I use mine every day multiple times a day and it\\'s held up greatVery nice machine. Nothing disappointing about it at all.I never write reviews but I have to say this is the best coffee out of any machine I’ve ever had including any at a coffee stand 100 percent get this.I\\'ll preface this review by stating that I am an espresso drinker. I have an automatic espresso machine, which I love, and that is the bar I used for my comparison. I will say that the coffee produced by this machine is as good as the coffee from my expensive espresso machine.\\n\\nI like the option of a quick coffee for some variety. I have had Keurigs for years, and am probably on my 5th rendition. The more I drank espresso, the more dissatisfied I became with the Keurig. I found myself having to use 2 k-cups to get one cup of coffee strong enough for my liking. I then saw the nespresso online, and began to research the machine. Although there are minor complaints about it, the majority of reviews were positive, so I decided to buy one.\\n\\nI was torn between the older model and the vertuso model. The attraction of the older model is 3rd party coffee pods, which saves money but after watching many a youtube review, it appeared the vertuso produced a better coffee with more crema. I opted for the vertuso plus deluxe. The deluxe model has a larger water tank and chrome accents.\\n\\nThe machine was simple to set up. Just fill the water tank, plug it in, make sure it had a container under the spout, and it went through a priming/rinsing cycle. The machine comes with 12 sample pods, each different. I immediately made a coffee and it was amazing! The flavor was excellent. It was more impressive than my expensive espresso machine (likely due to my choice of beans). I\\'ve since had several drinks from the machine and am pleased with each. The machine knows the right amount of water, brew time, brew temp for each pod, due to the bar codes. I no longer need to use 2 k-cups to get a decent cup of coffee, so the price per cup ends up the same as the Keurig. I spent about $.50 per k-cup, and each nespresso capsule is about $1. The brew time is longer than the Keurig, but shorter than my espresso machine (however, my machine grinds the beans for each cup).\\n\\nI love this machine. I immediately ordered more sleeves of pods from nespresso\\'s website. My order was shipped the next day and arrived 2 days later! Also, the machine comes with a $10 coupon for pods and you get samples with each order.\\n\\nThis machine is fantastic. I have given it 5 stars. It is worth the price, if you like quality coffee. Not even Starbuck\\'s makes a better espresso! Buy it!Now that I\\'ve had the machine for a few months, I wanted to say the Nespresso machine works just fine; I\\'m enjoying the coffee and it\\'s ease of use.I love be everything about my Nespresso. Coffee is so fresh. Not like my keurig. My k-cups were starting to taste stale, the coffee would spray everywhere and I had to microwave every cup of coffee immediately after brewing. With the Nespresso my coffee is ALWAYS piping hot, it stays hot. The customer service from Nespresso is amazing. Free samples, free gifts with orders and they send you recycling bags pre-paid labeling so u can recycle the pods. Not to mention it is very clean and precise. Im in love. I could also go on about the frothier. I use it for my cream, hot or cold BTW. It’s amazingI was very skeptical about buying one. I felt it would be to good to be true. I asked a friend of mine how he liked his and he surprised me with how quickly he said “I love it.”. We both went to Starbucks for our daily fix prior to getting one. I don’t want to mislead you but this isn’t a Starbucks espresso, if that’s what you are looking for. This is a very simple and quick fix for your espresso needs. I absolutely love it. I’m disappointed I didn’t buy it sooner.Great coffee but for 2 people to have a 7.7 oz. cup a day costs $75 per month.Best coffee system on the market but hard to get pods forThis one is much better than the Next machine. However! - I did end up with a defective model with the first shipment. But - I called Nespresso and they actually replaced it with a new unit. Mine wasn\\'t ejecting the pods, which apparently is a pretty common defect. Other than that, I hope you have a lot of $$$ for the Vertuo pods - since they might put you into bankruptcy. But since I love the espresso it\\'s a luxury. The coffee though is bleh, you\\'re much better off with a french press.First tried this machine at a hotel stay in Scottsdale and fell in love. Purchased this machine for my home and have not been disappointed. Great coffee, great flavor.. love the frothier!! 9 out of 10 would buy again!!!Slim lined and easy to use with the pods (hot water takes a little getting used to but not difficult either). The water tank is also easily removed and replaced for refills.\\n\\nThe different pods are automatically given the correct amount of water - so no guessing is inolved. Nesspresso pods coffee has much better flavor and mouth feels than the Keurig. We won\\'t be purchasing another Keurig again.Taste great as advertised but at what expense to calories, I don’t know. The Fritcher never worked or I can’t figure it out. It took several attempt to figure out the coffee machine. Now that I can open and close with pods, I don’t know how to control the amount or if that’s even possible. So it makes a small amount. It is nice to make a single “small” cup of coffee but like it said, small!!! For the price, would be nice to have more to a single pod. I tried all the flavors. Yum. Not one bad one. So 5-star for taste. I would like to send back the frother for replacement to get what I paid for. Wonder if I can but I tossed the box. Ugh.I was never much of a coffee drinker but my girlfriend got me starting to enjoy it and suggested I buy a Neapresso and after researching rhe different models I decided on the Vertuo Plus and it’s fantastic!!I’ve been looking for a good coffee machine for a while now. I bought the Nespresso vertuo next but after reading multiple bad reviews, I decided to return it and buy this one instead. Best decision I ever made!! It runs so smooth, makes delicious coffee, and the customer service is great. So happy with this purchase :)So far I like this product.LOVE my Nespresso so much. Don\\'t buy even 1/3 of the coffeehouse drinks I used to! Quick, convenient and delicious coffee!? Yes, please!!I know you\\'re down here looking at reviews trying to convince yourself to buy one.\\n\\nDo it, just do it. Trust me.\\n\\nMy wife and I got ours in and immediately agreed that it\\'s some of the best money we\\'ve ever spent. The coffee is flavorful and delicious, it\\'s easy to clean and maintain and the Nespresso pod recycle program is a huge plus.Easy to use and the best frothing everI bought this as a replacement since my last coffee maker died. The selections are great, the casings can be recycled, and the coffee options are great. Espresso, double espresso, cafe, large cafe, and a carafe. Plus it came with a frother for milk/cream. It’s a great value compared to buying an espresso machine and is easy to use.\\n\\nAdvice: read the initial setup instructions to flush the system and rinse everything. You can also use this to purge in the future. There is only one button on the device.I bought the combo Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Milk Frother. The Frother was defective right out of the box. I am confident this was a QC over site. Three stars for now.I\\'ve tried a more traditional auto espresso machine first, but the taste wasn\\'t good, and the maintenance wasn\\'t easy as expected, even though the machine price was much higher. But this Nespresso machine is SO EASY to use! It makes impressive rich crema even for a regular coffee. The Vertuo capsules are more expensive than regular coffee, but it\\'s definitely worth it. I was worried about the water leak since some people mentioned it in the review, but I haven\\'t experienced any trouble at all so far. If you\\'re considering it, I highly recommend it. It was one of the best purchases ever!Absolutely love the frothy nesshey all...this is the best....save your time running to Starbucks only to be bombarded with soccer moms ordering outrageous drinks for their kids and taking away your personal time...buy this and do it at home...This is my 3rd Nespresso. The second one stopped working after a few weeks so I returned it to BB& B & bought a better one on Amazon and now the frother doesn\\'t work. I contacted amazon & was told to contact Nespresso which I did. After 1 hour on phone with an offshore operator, we got the frother to work on the lower level but all it does with the full cup is warm the milk. this is no where near as good as the original frother and I am thinking about sending this one back to & changing machines altogether to another brand but I love the flavor of their coffees. What a dilemma😒This is my first Nespresso machine and boy was I glad I got it!\\nAfter doing research I decided on the Vertuo Plus machine and it has been great so far in the month I have had it. Coffee taste fresh, has nice foam, and is easy to use once you get the hang of it.Easy to use. Would buy again.The manual is not clear.\\nThe starting of brewing the cup is not clear. It takes making 3 cups to figure it out.\\n\\nThe product leaked in the bottom\\nSee picturesLove this coffee machine!!! I purchased for my husband’s Birthday. He said these coffees are better than any he has every drank anywhere!!\\nSo easy to use and perfection with every cup!\\nJust buy it!We are very pleased with our Nespresso! It’s easy to use, quick, and consistently produces a good cup of coffee. I would definitely recommend it over Keurig. The downside is the pods being more expensive and that you have to use the Nespresso brand. Hopefully they change that soon!Excellent addition to our home. Love it much more than a bulky coffee pot. The matte black is so rich looking. Easy to use and replace water tank. Aero machine froths milk, half and half and even dairy free creamer. Really enjoying my purchase !I was so tired of not liking my coffee in the morning. I had a Keurig for years and gave it away then went to the ‘pour over’ method, got a water filter, pretty much tried everything . Finally I decided I was worth it and bought this Nespresso machine and now I look forward to my mornings again!I honestly prefer the coffee from this company over Starbucks now. I almost exclusively use coffee products from Nespresso now. I am saving money now since I almost never buy coffee from Starbucks. A big fan of Nespresso.This machine is so easy to use and makes the best coffee!!! Does not use up a lot of space!!!\\nHighly recommend it!!!!I love this coffee maker. It’s great. The espresso and coffee tastes soooo good.Easy to use.After hemming and hawing over this I pulled the Trigger. A great decision. Best coffee you can make at home. Read a few reviews that said the coffee wasn\\'t hot, which held up my purchase, however it is every bit as hot as my Keurig. The milk frother is excellent, if you use half and half there isn\\'t any liquid at all, all froth. As good as Keurig is, it can\\'t hold a candle to this. Just making regular coffee it\\'s great. A little pricey for a home brew, but a quarter of the cost as Starbucks, and is just as good, if you really get into it with flavors and technique, you can beat Starbuck\\'s Latte\\'s and cappuccinos hands down. If you\\'re a coffee fanatic like me. you\\'ll love this machine.I am absolutely loving this nespresso machine. It is super covenant with the swivel water tank and can work on any space on my counter. I like how easy it is to remove the water tank as well (not awkward like a keurig). I do wish pods weren’t so expensive or nespresso would make reusable ones but overall I have no complaints. With the frother I honestly could live without it. It overflows easily and won’t just heat the milk. There is also no option for amount of froth.I was disappointed that Nespresso has discontinued the Alto (14 oz) serving size \"pod\". I usually start my day with a 15 oz cup of coffee; now I have to use two 7.7 oz pods. This makes what is already the most expensive home-brew cup of coffee almost as expensive as Starbucks. Otherwise, I like the speed and convenience of the machine.I used to like coffee well enough, but I didn’t drink it often, I went elsewhere for my caffeine fix... but I tried a nespresso espresso years ago and never stopped thinking about it, haha.\\n\\nI finally decided to treat myself and now I’m obsessed with coffee. I look forward to waking up to get my espresso fix, and sometimes I even sneak another cup when I get home from work. It’s just completely changed the game for me and I love that they give you a sample pack. The quality of the coffee is just incredible and I’m thrilled with it.\\n\\nThose are the pros, but there are SOME cons.\\n\\nThis particular machine worked flawlessly the first couple of uses but now the button isn’t quite responsive and it takes a moment or two for it to start brewing. By that, I mean I thought maybe the water was low, so I went to fill it and half way through filling it the machine started brewing. It was a mad dash to turn it off.\\n\\nNext, there’s the matter of the pods. More so the attainability and availability of them. Williams Sonoma sells the original line but for some reason Nestle hasn’t released the the vertuo line to them yet, which, suffice it to say, is stupid.\\n\\nShipping an online order directly from nespresso takes a minimum of 3 business days for my location, which, maybe I’m spoiled by amazon, but not a fan of that.\\n\\nAaaaaand, seasonal creations sell out FAST, so you gotta pay attention to those emails, folks. Don’t sit on them.\\n\\nAlso, Nespresso boutiques are hard to come by. I live in a major metroplex and there’s only one about 90 minutes from me. If they’re going to be stingy about how many locations they have, why not allow Williams Sonoma to handle some of that retail?\\n\\nBottom line, it’s DECADENT coffee but it’s a bit of a pain in the ass to obtain.Update - great coffee, works as advertised. The directions are in french so useless. The pods - some are labeled, most are not making it impossible to know what each one is. Illogical why they would do this.Ordered the Nespresso Virtuo to make my husband coffee and hopefully not have to visit Starbucks as much! Various flavors of coffee provided, very easy to use. Great product!Bought as a gift for my 20yr old son, he LOVES it! Flavors are great but in my opinion, not cheap! Cheaper than buying a daily fancy coffee from a shop tho I guess. Also, pods aren’t as widely available as K-cups are. I guess that’s what makes this one different. Still, it makes great coffee!I was suppose to received my machine on a Monday, but I got it 2 days early and was thrilled it came so fast! Set up was easy, and running water through it before making a coffee was straight forward. I have made 3 coffees since receiving it this morning, and so far, so good! The machine is nice, but I’ve seen mixed reviews about longevity. I will update my review if something goes sideways - but as of right now, I am loving it. I chose to order my first pods through nespresso directly. They came quickly, 3 days or so.I purchased this model as replacement for the Vertuo Next model that was frustrating me with quality issues. I had three different Next models in 3 months due to defects (leaking, loose parts or no consistent coffee). Thankfully Nespresso & Costco replaced and accepted return after the 3rd dud. My daughter has the Vertuo Plus model for almost 2 years without any issues so I went for it. So far the Vertuo Next has been working great & I am happy with the consistent quality of coffee is puts out.Got this after experiencing one at a friend’s. Really like the coffee, better than the smaller Nespresso version (and quieter!). Too bad the capsules cost so much, and the Starbucks ones that fit are even more expensive. It’s a value compared with going out to Starbucks but outrageous compared with any home alternative. Unfortunately, the product is so good that we’re happy to pay for it. :-)I waited to write this review after seeing some comments in other reviews that the machine enters a descaling mode and breaks about three months in. Well, I\\'ve had my machine since Christmas (gift to myself) and I\\'ve had no such problem. I\\'ve been enjoying my coffee ritual so much now that I also bought a milk frother, but not the nespresso branded one as that seems too expensive. I love that I can make any coffee drink I desire. I love the different size pods, and how you can program each pod size to brew a certain volume of coffee. My favorite pods are the alto pods, which is new with this machine. And I love that I can feel good about having \"pod coffee\" again with their pod recycling program.\\nNow, about descaling. Last week, I descaled my machine for the first time and had no problems and the coffee is back to tasting like new. I thought the machine would warn me when it needed to be descaled, but 5 months in I never got the warning and figured I better be proactive. I\\'ve been using filtered water in the machine, so maybe that held off some of the buildup. I find coffee tastes better with filtered water anyway.\\nBut, the machine was getting noisier, and the coffee was starting to sputter when coming out of the spout, so I thought it might be time to descale. So I used one of their descaling packs and followed the directions in my manual. The machine did its thing and now I\\'m back to like new operation with less noise again and more flavor for about a week. I wonder if perhaps the problems people had are because the machine\\'s setting lets the buildup get too bad before prompting you to descale.\\nLast tip is Nespresso has a wide range of coffee profiles, so I suggest trying sample packs (and always ordering your free 2-pack when ordering pods on the Nespresso site) to find the right flavor profile for you. I love this machine and love having my morning coffee now!Very happy with the machine. It amazed me everyday with a coffee full of foam. I thought the foam was from milk but it turns out the machine is the magic maker, it turns a pod of coffee powder into a cup of coffee with creamy foam.\\nJust amazing! If I had to pick , this is the best thing I bought from Amazon so far in 2022.I am a self-proclaimed coffee snob. I was getting frustrated that at my office I only had a mini Keurig and the coffee just tasted horrible. It took forever to heat up and the coffee was just meh. Someone mentioned the Nespresso to me so I took a chance and ordered it. I cannot believe how much better the coffee is! The whole machine is such better quality than the Keurig. The way that it heats up the water so fast and disposes of the pod for you is amazing! It is SO a much more efficient than the Keurig. It’s a gorgeous design and the functionality is impressive. For the price, I cannot believe I hadn’t bought this sooner. It’s amazing!We owned a Keurig before and I am glad we made this upgrade. I am a coffee drinker and I am fine with using instant coffee throughout the day. This is good when I am craving that good coffee in the afternoon or in the evening after the end of my work day. We have stopped craving Starbucks coffee because of this.\\nLove the ease of operation and the size. It is much smaller than a Keurig machine and looks great in the kitchen. Also I love that you can recycle the coffee pods by sending the used coffee pods to Nespresso in a postage paid envelope. I love this easy method. With Keurig, although you get recyclable pods, you have to separate the coffee, throw it in the regular trash and then dispose the remaining pack in the recycling bin. With this, you dump all the used pods in the postage paid envelope, pack it once its full and drop it at a nearby UPS.\\nThe only downside if the cost of the pods. It comes to approximately a dollar to $1.5 per cup depending on the coffee and the deals/coupons you get. But this is gourmet coffee and something I drink only once a day (twice if I had a long day). For regular coffee, the instant coffee works for me.\\nBut overall worth a buy if you are a coffee lover and want to upgrade your game.Why was I spending countless dollars, hundreds of dollars on Starbucks a month when I could of had this all along. The foam on this thing is insane for one thing and two the flavors of all the pods are too die for. Goodbye Starbucks, Goodbye rusty old Keurig machine and hello Nespresso. This thing is now part of the family, I may even leave it in my will and will it to a family member because of how wonderful it is. Run, don\\'t walk, to your Amazon cart and buy this now. You\\'ll thank me!!!I love the ease of use and the flavor of the coffee pods I purchased.Our machine did not come with directions and I wish the pods were labeled so you can see what they are.Loud way too LoudThis coffee maker is the best and makes the perfect coffee!!This machine reads a bar code on the pod to dispense the exact amount of water for the type. Nice head of foam on every cup. The types of pods offered are terrific and many. Love this coffee machine.likes great coffee and espresso and easy to use; would prefer the cord to be in different position or the water reservoir be positioned differently to ensure water doesn’t come near the cord should there be a leakI was a little hesitant to spend this much money on a coffee maker but with the amount of times I go to Starbucks I figured it would be worth a try. When I received the package I felt like it was Christmas morning! I couldn\\'t wait to open it up and drink as much coffee/espresso that I could. The machine is very sleek and doesn\\'t take up much room. It also came with a milk frother which has been a game changer!! Not only does it make hot foam but you can also make cold foam for your iced drinks. I definitely feel like a barista in my own kitchen! They also provided a sample pack of nespresso pods. It was kind of like coffee roulette. My husband and I would pick different pods and then determine which we like best. The only downfall I have noticed so far is the availability of the pods. A chunk that we did like or want to try were out of stock on the nespresso website and besides Amazon, the only place I have found them so far are at a few select target stores (I heard bed bath and beyond has them too but have not gone yet). Overall this purchase has not only made me feel like a kid with a brand new toy but it\\'s also been saving me money since I barely go to Starbucks now.Es fácil de usar , divina estoy enamorada de ella April 28, 2019\\nReview of Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De\\'Longhi with Aeroccino, Grey\\nPROS\\nThe coffee tastes better than starbucks or anywhere that makes it. It creates a frothy foam on the top of the coffee and really makes it an excellent cup. This is about 10x better than kureg as far as taste. Initial setup was easy out of the box. First cups were perfect and the machine made them without issue.\\nCONS\\nAfter about 2 months we have run into a few problems. The machine does not consistently work and continues to throw out the error code of \"no water\" or \"water container empty\" even when there is water in it. See the video for proof. After about 10-15 attempt it works and makes a cup. Luckily it doesn\\'t reject the pod and it can be reused (even though it doesn\\'t really even use it). Note this doesn\\'t happen every time and usually it is the 2nd cup of the day that we end up fighting with the machine on. The other major complaint I have about this machine is precisely the way it tells you the error code. There is no display which code show a code. In stead you have to watch the flashing light and count how many red or green lights flash and how long they stay eliminated. Then you have to use the manual to look up the red/green code. Why can\\'t you just have a $2 display that shows the status of the machine...WOW! What century are we in...lets make the error code reading as complicated at we can that way the user has to guess at the actual problem. Come on nespresso! Even a $5 calculator has a digital display. OK, back to the issue. As you can see on the video there is water in the carafe yet the machine continue to through an error. We are getting more and more frustrated by the cup. I will leave the rating at 3 stars but only because the coffee is so damn good.... when it does create a cup full.\\n\\nUPDATE 5/11/2019\\nOk. Now we are going down to 1-star (from 3). The machine makes the first cup every morning just fine. The 2nd cup NEVER works. The \"refill water\" light flashing comes on after you press the button to start the 2nd cup. I called customer service at Amazon and because we are over the 30-day window (actually 35) Amazon won\\'t take it back. They patch me into Nespresso hot-line and then Nespresso wants to troubleshoot the problem, all over again. After talking to two people at Nespresso and arguing over what the red flashing light means and actually reading the manual to the Nespresso person on the phone she finally agrees to \"repair\" the machine. At first she wanted to ONLY send an empty UPS box so the machine could be sent to be \"repaired by a technician\". She told me that process would take about 2-weeks. I told her that was unacceptable and I needed coffee. She reluctantly agreed to send a \"loaner\" machine that we could use while our machine is \"being repaired\". After an hour with her on the phone I was ready to give up. It was apparent she had a \"protocol\" that she had to follow in order to reduce the returns and get customers to give-up because their customer service process is too complicated or there is too much push-back from the representative. I\\'m overall very disappointed with Nespresso and wish I would have purchased the machine at the local target. At-least then I could just take it back or buy another one and then take this one back. Nespresso you need to whole-heartedly stand behind your product for greater than 35 days and not give your customers the run-around. Think about how many people I\\'m going to tell about my experience with your product and the poor customer service. Also, add a digital display to the machine, it can\\'t cost more than a free calculator display. A real code to read instead of a flashing light to count flashes like morse code would REALLY help your customers AND your customer service representatives in troubleshooting the errors...DUHH!I went to the Package locker room, typed in the code to open the locker, I found that there was no protective box, the product box was ripped open and then I saw that someone broke the seal on the coffee! I was so disappointed it came like this and I paid so much for it! I\\'m testing to see if the machine was damaged and looks like no one actually was able to pull out the coffee units.Good product, easy to use and preparing\\ndelicious coffeeI bought this to replace my Vertuo Next which started leaking during the brewing process after about two years. This machine makes much hotter coffee than the Next and I like the automatic open/close mechanism. It\\'s slightly larger than the Next but still fits well on my countertop. So far I prefer thus model to the newer Next.I did not realize Nesspresso machine are made by different brands. The coffee taste good. The machine works very well and has a small footprint. The only negative is the cup stand it is not quite wide enough for bigger mugs and you have to be careful. The machine made by Nesspresso has a much better cup stand. This one is made by De\\' LonghiBrews quickly and consistently\\nFlavorful and hot every cup👍👍Just a week prior to this purchase I bought the original espresso only nespresso not realizing there was a version that brewed coffee. I quickly returned that purchase and bought the vertuoline.\\n\\nThere are two versions / manufacturers of the nespresso vertuoline--- 1) DeLonghi (this one) and 2) Breville. I chose the DeLonghi version exclusively for the swivel water tank feature. Aside from this functional difference they appear to be identical aside from design appearance. I\\'m really glad I went with this one as it really comes in handy having the tank on same side as sink. I\\'ve even moved the machine to opposite side and swiveled the tank to accommodate it.\\n\\nIts important to note that this machine uses vertuoline size round pods ONLY. You cannot view the small espresso capsules. There is a line of espresso capsules that fit this machine however the selection is more limited than the original Nespresso line (it is however growing).\\n\\nBefore purchasing I read many reviews which mention a problem with the water temp being too cool. This comes down to preference- I would say this pumps out sufficiently hot coffee for my liking. I noticed the second consecutive cup brews a bit warmer than the first cup (maybe the machine warms up). Nespresso told us that you can prime the machine by brewing a cup of plain water first-- this hasn\\'t been necessary -- my hubby prefers his coffee extra hot so I always brew my cup first and his second. He\\'s had no complaints and doesn\\'t need to microwave it for additional heat.\\n\\nThe frother is also great- Try using low fat or no fat milk for the best front. I tried half and half and it doesn\\'t foam near as well. I wish the container had a lip to pour from but that\\'s my only feedback.\\n\\nI seen a Nespresso demo years ago at Target and I wish I had taken the leap sooner. In the bay area I had a daily Philz coffee 4$ day habit and I haven\\'t been once since this purchase. My favorite capsule is the Giornio. Add a splash of heavy whipping cream for perfection. Brews with a beautiful foam on top. Perfection!Easy to use. Great tasting coffee. Nespresso.com lots of flavors, easy to order.I am forever ruined for \"regular coffee\" I was given one for Christmas and I loved it so much I bought one for a family member\\'s birthday. It makes the best coffee, lattes, cappuccinos and espresso shots. The creama is fluffy and dreamy. The milk frother adds decadence. I look forward to the morning just so I can have my coffee. Am I pretentious? Probably. Do I care? Nope! :)Ni me vino la tazaEl mejor café hecho en la mejor máquina de café.I love my machine I use it almost everyday. has replaced going to Sbucks and other coffee shops because I have ne in the power of my own home! make sure to use filtered water if you can to keep machine lasting longer! so many great flavors and free samples from Nespresso!Bought this as anniversary gift for myself and husband. Arrived Feb 2…I was thrilled with this as a coffee or espresso machine, however after one month the pricey frother stopped frothing. Warm yes, froth no. Called Nespresso and after detailed video call was told it “ says to use 2% milk”. The add here says “all kinds of milk “. So no, my husband’s full fat milk, and my half and half are inappropriate. What? No offer for exchange. Wanted me to get other milk and have an on line “trouble shooting “ session. Not my idea of helpful. This is an expensive add on. I will go back to my many years old manual glass frother. Works well in less than 30 seconds and cleans in dishwasher! Hope the coffee machine holds up. Just missed the 30 day Amazon return date..Makes a good tasting cup of coffee or Expresso quicklyI am IN LOVE with this Nespresso machine! I was going to Starbucks 2× a week and now that I have this incredible machine, I\\'ve not gone once. My Espresso drinks are so so much more tasty than those at Starbucks! My favorite thing I\\'ve ever bought♡This is a wonderful machine for a great coffee experience. The Nespresso brand coffee pods are high quality, flavorful, and there is enough variety available to suit every taste. I haven\\'t found anything that I don\\'t like about the machine. I purchased the one with the milk frother because that is something that I enjoy.\\n\\nSome of the reviews stated that the coffee was not hot. With the frother, you can froth your milk or cream. If you don\\'t like froth, I would just microwave my cream in the coffee cup to heat it a little before brewing the coffee or just microwave the cup for a few seconds to take the chill off.\\n\\nThe Nespresso recycling program is especially easy and attractive for the consumer. The pods, in which the coffee comes, are aluminum. The company supplies free recycling bags which are already prepared with shipping label and shipping fee. All you have to do is put the used pods in the supplied bag, close (bag is self sealing), and drop at UPS. Easy peasy. When you order your coffee pods, if you need recycling bags you add them to your shopping cart for free. I love how this company has made recycling of their product easy and seamless for the consumer.NAGreat product , I make nice coffee ☕️ everyday, Easy and more convenient if you have busy scheduleBought this for the office and love it! The only negative is pods are a little more pricey than other pod coffee\\'s.\\n\\nIt couldn\\'t be easier to use, and I love that there is a Pod \"trash can\" on the back that the used pods get dumped into.I like how easy it is to use and the great strong flavor of the coffee.Didn\\'t seem worth the moneyAdmittedly I am a coffee snob. Every morning I brew a French press with expensive beans ground fresh in a burr grinder. Nespresso isn’t the same but is the best single serve coffee out there. Taste pretty damn good considering the effort level.I have it already for three months. It is easy to use and easy to maintain. The design is solid. It makes the coffee of different types and sizes by reading the barcode on the pod. Just be aware that it uses one type of coffee pods and they are relatively expensive compared to the others. Hopefully, the other coffee producers will start offering the pods so the price might come down like it happened to K-Cup.Came with the aerocinno which was BRAND NEW in the box. The thing still had the wrap on the water tanks. Literally brand new quality for HALF the price. Thank you so much.Needed a coffee taste and strength that would meet the expectation of my Caribbean home grown coffee flavor. With the machine and selections I was quite satisfied. My friends are too, as I have been proud to serve them a cup of coffee knowing that it would not dissappoint.2-year edit: Unit has started to leak underneath. Contacted Nespresso is no help. They will have you go through the long-drawn-out cleaning, and doesn\\'t fix a thing. They want you to empty the pods each time. Don\\'t leave them in the catch container, or they will drip.\\n\\nEDIT: Flavors, oh man, you have to try the Caramelizio, Bianco Leggero (over milk) and the Bianco Forte (over milk)\\n\\nMakes good coffee, I\\'m still searching for the perfect flavor, but the machine itself is a work of art. I love the mechanical head lifting and how it disposes of the used capsule to it\\'s container held in the back. It\\'s actually pretty high-tech, so if anything malfunctions, there is an easy way to reset it without issue.\\n\\nYour machine may need to be reset to its factory settings, to correct the amount of water dispensed through your capsules. To return to factory settings, we recommend the following steps:\\n\\nTap the lever upward, to eject any used capsule from the capsule chamber, then tap the lever downward, to close the head of the machine.\\nPush the lever down for approximately 3 seconds, until the green light goes out, to turn off the machine.\\nPress and hold the coffee button and lever down, simultaneously, for approximately 3 seconds, until the light is steady orange, then release the lever.\\nPress the lever down 3 times. The light should start blinking quickly in a pattern of 3 blinks and a pause.\\nOnce the blinking pattern is established, press and release the coffee button.\\nThe light will blink 3 times slowly, to confirm the reset, then turn a steady green.Was so excited to receive my Nespresso machine after watching so many tiktok videos.\\nBox was in good condition brand new, although when i opened it up & proceeded to open the top for first time there were already grounds inside machine.\\nHadn’t looked used but took 5x to finally run clear.\\nI did call Amazon & they helped me with it initially & suggested I run it through the cleaning cycle several times. They were so helpful they even called nespresso & I talked with them while Amazon waited on other line.\\nIn the end I did return this Nespresso because the pods did not slide off the prongs. It maybe slid off 5x if that. The machine worked fine produced hot espresso, quite, easy to use, didn’t take up a lot of space but for me that was also part of the intrigue\\nI did order a different nespresso machine have already received it & already using it.\\nNo grounds, has slid off of prongs right away.\\nLove it...The espresso was great. However, I found the machine very difficult to use, and am therefore returning it.\\nFirst of all, there is one button, and one button only, that will flash to express what is happening. Fine, except there are about 40 different color/speed combinations and you need to figure out the difference between a fast blinking red light and a rapid blinking red light.\\nIf you only want the same type of coffee every single day, this machine is perfect. There’s one button, and it’s easy and clean. However, if you ever want to switch the size of the cup you’re having or switch another function, it’s about an hour of clicking a single button, diagnosing a blinking light, and experimenting to see if you got it right. Not worth the time for most people.After I used all my sample pack I bought some Costa Rica blend. It’s easy, fast and very good.Two buttons to press for coffee, and it’s delicious stuff.\\n\\nI always hated pod coffee. This changed my mind. It’s a gorgeous design as well!I purchased this as a birthday gift for my daughter, after she used one in a hotel and raved about it. She absolutely loves it!Based on reviews, I expected to obtain a superior cup of coffee. (I had been buying Starbucks.) It takes a while to sort though all the flavors to find one that is acceptable, not necessarily better than other coffee brands. Additionally, you have to get used to foamy coffee, similar to a latte. If you put cream or milk in your coffee, the coffee temperature may be too cool. The directions indicate that you should put the milk in first and stir the mixture when ready. However, I still need to put the cup in the microwave for 20 seconds to obtain a hot cup of coffee. Finally, the cost of the pods is more than I expected. Each pod costs $1.00 +. There is also a difference in the amount of coffee provided per pod. Unfortunately, the flavor my husband likes only provides a half a cup of coffee. You have to consider the flavor as well as the size of the pod in making a selection. He also has to add sugar to improve the flavor, which he had not needed to do before. Therefore, the cost-value benefit of this system may be an issue depending on your coffee preferences. I found that there are just too many usage restrictions and adaptations. I suggest that you view the YouTube presentations before buying or using this coffee system for the first time. There is a link on the Nespresso website. The videos are very good and will help in understanding how this system works. Additionally, Nespresso\\'s customer service and delivery system are excellent. They do provide a wide variety of flavors and coffee types.Me gusta todoThe bride and groom love this. Had lunch with them and they gave me a demonstration. Delicious coffee and easy to use. I do think of giving this as a gift you should also get some compatible coffees so they can try it right away.I purchased the Nespresso VertuoPlus and love it. My only complaint is the milk frothier is missing one of the whisks. Since I’ve been using the machine and don’t want to deal with the hassle of returning it I’ll have to reach out to the seller to see if they will ship a whisk to me.\\n\\nI first tried Nespresso at my friends and liked it but wanted a larger quantity than an espresso. I didn’t know that there are machines that brew larger quantities, 8oz and 14oz.\\n\\nYeah it’s not as cheap as brewing a cup of coffee but I wasn’t doing that either. Instead I was buying a cup every day at work for $2. So for me it’s cheaper.\\n\\nI have to say the coffee is much better tasting than Keriug, not sure if I spelled that correctly, and Starbucks.\\n\\nThe machine is very easy to use. Push up on the lever to open, the motorized lid opens, drops the spent pod at the same time, install the new pod, press down on the lever to close, and push the button at top to start.\\n\\nThe milk frothier is extremely easy to use. Pour in the milk to one of the two fill lines, close and press the button. Since I only have the one whisk I’ve only filled it to the lower level and frothed hot milk for hot drinks. I haven’t used it yet, but if you press and hold the button for 2 seconds you can froth milk for cold drinks. Hot the button flashes red and cold it flashes blue. Pretty smart.\\n\\nIf you are considering this machine, what are you waiting for?\\n\\nUpdate 12/17/17: The instructions are not the most detailed, but I did notice that the provided whisk can be converted by removing the spring. In the lid there is a spring storage bracket when you are using the whisk without the spring. Therefore, the package came complete and I’ve upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I thought it was short one whisk.I know Nespresso coffee and espresso is awesome, but we haven\\'t quite gotten to the actual use of the machine because the color is an utter disappointment! The grey machine doesn\\'t look anything like the picture!! I was so excited about this and now I hate it every time I look at it. I would return, but shocking the price has gone up.DIL loves espresso & talked about this machine. A black Friday deal made the price more acceptable. Arrived quickly & well packaged. At Christmas my DIL was very happy. I haven\\'t tasted the coffee as I\\'m not an espresso lover. (I personally hate the taste) She & my son love the quality, ease of use & cleaning of the machine. A frother is included with this package which only added to their happiness. The pods are a little expensive, but that expense is on them.I always wait to put up reviews because you should use the product for a while before posting to help buyers decide. I bought this machine almost a year and a half ago and it is great. We also bought the glass stand/capsule holder at the same time. We love coffee in our home and this machine is especially a plus when you have guests and everyone likes different coffees. It makes an easy fabulous cappuccino with the frother. We use a standard coffee machine to brew a pot of coffee every morning and use this for our afternoon coffee fix. I don’t think the pods are expensive considering they cost an average of $1.00 each and you can’t get an espresso or cappuccino for less than $3-$5 and a regular American cup for almost $2. You also have many pod options for strength and taste so there is something for everyone. It is definitely a good buy. Several of my friends have now bought this machine after having coffee at my place. The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De\\'Longhi is my 2nd Nespresso machine. I purchased it almost six months ago and it has worked well for me.\\n\\nThe unit is much quieter than the Nespresso Pixie Espresso Maker I have and it heats up more quickly. For early morning use the Pixie is loud enough to wake up a light sleeper. That is not a worry with the new machine.\\n\\nI like the option to make full size cups of coffee and the selection of pods that came with the machine was varied enough to help me find the flavors I enjoy best. I will keep using the Pixie for espresso until the Veturoline espresso sized pods find a lower price-per-cup.\\n\\nI do think the price per Veturoline pod is high but that does not detract from the machine.\\n\\nI have read some reviews about a problem with scaling. I only use distilled water in all of my coffee machines and although I have only had this machine for just over 5 months, I have used my 1st Nespresso machine almost daily for over 2 years and I have not experienced any scaling issues with it.\\n\\nThe Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De\\'Longhi is a good machine and with a fair price. It is easy to use and easy to clean and has a larger water reservoir than expected. If you are interested in trying the Veturoline pods I recommend this machine.This machine makes good coffee! I make the ice leggaro in it every day and it’s been amazing. My main issues come from the machine itself. It is already malfunctioning and I’ve not had it even HALF a year yet. I’ve had it maybe 2-3 months. When I put the pod in it won’t let me make the coffee. I’ll put the top down and it’ll continue beeping green so then I have to take the pod out and reinsert and I’ll have to redo this process 3-4 sometimes more until it works. This means I’ll have to take the back off so I can catch the pod before it goes with the used ones. It’s just a hassle and not what I expect from a brand new coffee maker. Today was the final nail for me writing this review as I opened the machine to make coffee today and yesterday’s pod got STUCK on top so I had to remove the back (which had only one used pod in it as I just cleaned it) and then it fell and I was able to put the new pod in and go through with the stupid putting it in, closing machine, having to reopen and catch the pod before it goes to the back, then replace it, hope it works or continue this cycle till it does. I like the coffee this makes and I’m just so bummed by the quality of the machine.I don’t why they’re some negative reviews on this, but I absolutely loved mine. The self cleaning/rinsing process is easy. The machine made enough crema for my espresso, no leaks, flavorful espressos! here is my before and after I added my steamed/ frothed milk!. Loved them both ways!We are loving our Nespresso machine! It has definitely been a money saver! I had seen better reviews of this machine than the newer model, and it was slightly cheaper, so we went with this one. No complaints so far! Works great and is easy to use.This is definitely worth the extra money! The coffee is never watered down and the espresso is amazing!It comes with 20 pods but it’s hard to find affordable ones after thatThis is AMAZING! SO VERY happy!!\\n& LOVE the customer service with Amazon!I love this coffee machine and I love my coffee now more than ever! This has been the best purchase I made (after Snoo) during the difficult time of postpartum.\\nIt took me a very long time to choose a coffee machine and I\\'m glad I settled on this one. I no longer had (and still don\\'t have) the time to use my Bialetti, so I needed something to get me good coffee fast and easy with minimum effort and that\\'s what this machine gave me. Having read the reviews I was worried about leaking, but I thought occasional leaking was better than underheated coffee every time (like with some other Nespresso machines), because it at least can technically be fixed. But no fix needed, my machine does not leak a bit.\\nI like Aflorazio cups made with stevia and Nutpods vanilla oat creamer (I have a different brand of frother that I had purchased before my Nespresso) - makes great latte! Gives me something to look forward to every morning especially now that we have to mostly stay indoors due to the virus and so much smog.Gifted to daughter and she likes it. Hasn\\'t said anything bad yetI bought this because my old nespresso machine (as in really, really old) is finally starting to give up the ghost. I always wanted the kind that made coffee too but they were simply too expensive in the past for me to consider.\\n\\nFinally got one, and love it! I was a bit worried because apparently some of this line leak, but I have had zero problems with mine so far (I\\'ve had it about a week). I realized that because I usually make a morning latte that has two espresso shots in it (ie. two of the capsules) I would be better off with a machine that makes coffee too, so I got this one. I LOVE the coffee. Make no mistake: this machine is NOTHING like a keurig, and if you like keurig coffee, this is NOT for you. This machine makes strong, lucious coffee with crema on the top, which I love, and it also makes espresso. If you regularly go out for coffee at a place like Starbucks or somewhere else that makes fancy coffee drinks, you\\'ll love this, but if you\\'re after the kind of insipid drink that passes for coffee in a lot of the US, this will not be for you. I had given up on drinking drip coffee completely, because it\\'s usually not strong/tasty enough for me, so I alternate between making a cold brew myself and this machine, and it keeps me going.\\n\\nOne small nitpick: I actually like the espresso from my old machine a bit more, because my old one had no auto-shut off, and I could adjust the strength of the espresso to my own purposes. I also prefer a bit less crema on my espresso than this makes. But it\\'s a mild complaint.\\n\\nI\\'m in love with this machine!I never bought into the \"pod\" coffee makers (hello planet earth), but finally got talked into it (thanks instagram influencers - yes, we know you send them free coffee makers to promote it, no secrets here). This one came with a pod sampler pack which was delightful. I promptly used my promo code included in the box and ordered 50 pods. The pods are VERY expensive (80 cents to $1.80). Hopefully their patent expires and opens up more options eventually. A lot of reviews said the coffee maker was quiet, but i wouldn\\'t call it that, you can definitely hear it and i would say that it\\'s actually kind of loud. The milk frother is my favorite part - do not get the maker without the frother. Half and half works best, and it even heats up the creamer to a pretty hot temperature. If you\\'re on the fence about getting this, i would say definitely expect to pay more for coffee overall, but it\\'s the price you pay for getting into the Nespresso Club.So easy to use, right out of the box! I bought the red, which looks fabulous in my kitchen. The machine itself is sturdy, heavy and not \"plastic-y\" - which is hard to find these days! The coffee itself - amazing. Smooth, rich and flavorful. Very glad I decided to treat myself!The coffee is better than Starbucks! Will not go back to the regular drip coffee either!Listen I have been highly disappointed before with older Keurig Coffee maker models and skeptical about \"pod systems\"I have been using a french press for a little over 2 years now since my last \"machine\" I have been super anti coffee or espresso machines because nothing really beat Starbucks or Coffee Bean and the full flavor I was happy to pay for.... UNTIL a friend of mine just made me an espresso from this Nespresso machine! It was insanely delicious! Full of flavor and BOLD and there are so many options to choose from when it comes to pods and picking out a flavor and delivery on Amazon in Los Angeles is same day delivery and you can order on the Nespresso app as well!\\n\\nTo me if you are questioning this machine and to a Keurig, just forget about the Keurig all together you\\'ll be disappointed in the long run and will eventually buy a Nespresso machine.\\n\\nPrice break down for buying pods is $1.10 each when you buy 1 sleeve of 10 pods.\\n\\nThats cheaper than a cup of coffee from McDonald\\'s just saying this machine will save you tons of money and will most likely not have you caring about Starbucks or Coffee Bean when you can simply make the same cup of coffee for less at home.Bought my machine 11 months ago before having a problem with brewing capacity. Still under warranty so I called Nespresso. They gladly offered to repair it however they said processing time is two weeks.... I have coffee every day. So I decided to just order a second machine and have the repaired one for back up..... The next one I ordered SAID on the main product site it was from the Nespresso store but the fine print under the order information said it was from secondary seller. It came broken. Processed a return for it thru Amazon. They sent the label, I shipped it back. Then they cancelled the order. Product not available. Now I have no refund and no product. Amazon is working on a refund but web site was very misleading as to who was actually fulfilling the order. I called Nespresso and their response was, sorry to hear about it let us help you order another new machine and btw you will pay full price for a brand new machine. Not my idea of stellar customer service. Bottom line... verify who is shipping, pay no mind to the company listed in the main description and Nespresso..... well they are really sorry...Bought as a wedding shower for my niece. She was so excited and thrilled. Best coffee ever. No need to visit Starbucks anymore!My third Nespresso. Makes excellent coffee.This is my 4th Nespresso machine (home, office, in-laws house, my overseas house). Great as always, Enjoying my morning coffeesI seriously love this machine. I was an avid Starbucks customer spending $30 a week in coffee. It got to a point where I knew I could save so much money by just making lattes at home. So I invested in this bad boy and have been using it every day since. It was very easy to set up and clean. And I love the milk frother (I add my syrup with the milk to infuse the flavor). And when I’m done, the little pods all fall back into a storage space that I empty out once a week (so freakin convenient). I’ve had no problems other than it makes the lights in my kitchen flicker when it’s running but I’m sure it’s just got something to do with my little house.Disappointed because the coffee isn’t hot enough. I actually have to heat my cup with hot water in the microwave before I make the coffee. I was renovating my kitchen was I purchased it so I didn’t try it right away or I would have returned it. Very disappointed.I love this machine! It brews strong HOT coffee! I look forward to a cup of coffee every morning.When my keurig died I was forced to choose whether or not to stay with that line of products and took a gamble and tried this. I have to admit I was surprised that the quality of coffee was markedly better, smoother in texture, and the coffee capsules that I\\'ve tried thus far (melozio and Columbia) are better in taste. I haven\\'t had any of the issues of the coffee not being hot enough, so not sure what those reviews are about.\\n\\nThe coffee produced has a sort of espresso style crema which I did not know was a thing (I\\'m not a coffee snob, I just like a solid cup of coffee). Pictured is my likely mishandling of the aeroccino, still trying to figure out how to get maximum froth.\\n\\nAlso, I like that nespresso can be recycled (have to get bags and then drop that off at a ups store) so if you want to save the planet you can\\n\\nGo get this machine!This is our first Nespresso machine. Oh.. my... goodness.... My wife wife fell in love. She\\'s a coffee addict and has yet to make a cup she hasn\\'t loved. Sometimes she forgets to froth the creamer and it\\'s still awesome.I love this Nespresso, I had been looking at either this or the Vertuo Next and decided to go with this machine based on other reviews. Its easy to use, love the pods and how easy it is to order from Nespresso\\'s website. I had a Keurig and never used it but I\\'ve used this every day and the drinks taste like I got them from Starbucks.This is my first Nespresso Vertuoline machine and I love it. I got it on sale for $113 on Black Friday with the milk frother.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the ease of use of this espresso machine. You press the top coffee button and the machine warms up, the green light becomes steady and it\\'s ready to brew. Put in your favorite capsule and close the top lid and press the coffee button. Did I mention the motorized capsule lid? The lid opens and closes itself with a touch of the lever and disposes the capsules into its bin on the back of the machine.\\n\\nMilk frother is even easier to use. Just pour the milk in and press the button. Adding the froth of milk makes you feel like a real barista! You can totally make the same exact drinks as they make at Starbucks for the fraction of the cost. And the drinks are super strong depending on which intensities you choose.\\n\\nI paired this machine with double-walled coffee/espresso cups also purchased on Amazon. Much better than your everyday ceramic cups so you can see what you\\'re drinking and the art you just created in the cups. I also purchased the storage drawer holder for capsules that stores the capsules and machine on top (see pics)!\\n\\nThis is like any other home appliance. You have to upkeep things like this. Clean it. Maintain it. If you don\\'t do any of these things, things will eventually break. And for the people that gave this product 1 star, return it if it\\'s broken?Bought this as a gift for my husband he loves itI consider myself a Coffee Enthusiast. I care a lot about the quality and taste of my coffee. This coffee machine has made my everyday life tremendously more enjoyable. I am pleased with the features of this machine which include: easy access to the water tank, easy touch lever to put the espresso pod in, the fact that it includes the milk frother (big bonus), and that it makes great tasting coffee. Prior to purchasing this coffee machine- I did my fair share of research. Something that particularly stood out to me that made me want to purchase the product that made it unique to other coffee machines, is that it uses barcode recognition and a brewing extraction system. There is a different barcode for every different coffee type on each capsule and the machine adjusts the flow and volume of water, temperature, infusion time and capsule rotation to make the best coffee. This was an upgrade from my standard Keurig which simply just pushes hot water through the coffee grounds. This product has changed my life!i love this machine and frotter so much,so i gave this set twice as a gift !\\nbest coffee ,my favorite once are hazelino muffin and vanilla custard\\nwhat a delight,Love my nespresso! I use it for everything from iced coffee to lattes. Pods are a splurge so need to be mindful of not drinking too many, but once you’ve switched to nespresso you can’t go back.I have never had better tasting coffee at home. I’m blown away. I’m hesitant because of all of the reviews I’ve seen about having trouble later on, so I’ll be back to update my review if I have issues, but I’ve used it twice now and am very happy. I’m happy with the milk frother as well- it handles my milk alternatives well, which can be rather difficult. It froths oat milk like a dream! I do wish the sample coffees they send were labeled better so I could reorder the ones I like- it shows a picture of all of the coffees, not just the ones in the box, so it’s difficult to identify some of them.I have to say that I do only use the espresso pods so I cannot vouch for all of the features! We have tried some that came in a sample pack and I was amazed with its barcode sensing capabilities! Makes the perfect cup or shot every time! Good size water storage and a little can in the back that can hold atleast 8 empty pods before needing to empty it!\\n\\nLOVE LOVE LOVE!Despite the negative experience with the first unit, I just bough the exact same model to replace it. But this time I bought the extended warranty. We\\'ll see if I need it. The last one started having electrical troubles after a few months, but I was still able to use it. But it finally stopped working about two weeks after the one-year warranty expired. I suppose I should have sent it back before one year was up.\\nThe unit is quite sturdy mechanically. It\\'s a bit confusing trying to get it to run the descaling process every few months. That\\'s partly when the electronics started acting funny. After that, the status light started showing half red half yellow when it should have shown green when it was ready to brew. But it still worked, so I ignored the incorrect light status.I\\'ve been wanting to buy a Nespresso for a while and finally did it . We love it it comes with a few samples so you can pick what you like. I no longer go to Starbucks I have it at home .When this product actually works, it is great. The coffee is delicious, there\\'s so much variety.\\n\\nThat said - I could not recommend this product. I gave 2 stars because it\\'s actually a good product when it actually works, but our 1st machine and 2nd machine both started to leak internally.\\n\\nPROS:\\nEasy to use\\nCoffee is delicious\\nGood selection of flavors on nespresso.com\\nThe coffee pods are recyclable; nepresso.com even sends you self-addressed envelops to send back the used pods, free of charge.\\n\\nNote: I\\'ve never used or tasted a Keurig so I can\\'t compare with other similar machines. I\\'ve had the a Mr. Coffee for the past 10 years and only switched to Nespresso after glowing reviews (and an Amazon sale).\\n\\nCONS:\\nLeaks after a few months!!! Our 1st machine leaked, our 2nd (replacment) also leaked!\\n\\nWe\\'ve bought the Nespresso Virtuo Plus back in December 2019 since it was on sale on Amazon.\\nAfter about 3 weeks, it started leaking at the bottom. It seems like the there was a clog somewhere inside the machine so coffee would get backed up and overflow. We did the recommended cleanings and descaling cleanings as well, but that didn\\'t help.\\n\\nWe did an exchange with Amazon and got the replacement end of January 2020. It was working beautifully, we did the recommended cleanings as per the manual\\'s schedule. It started leaking as well in middle of May 2020,, same issue as the 1st machine.\\n\\nSince it\\'s still covered under warranty (1-year manufacturer warranty), we called Nespresso customer support and they walked us through some troubleshooting (use a toothpick to pick out clogs, do a clean cycle with hot water) but it still leaks, so they are sending us a box so we can send back the Vertuo Plus so they can fix it and send it back. We are potentially without coffee for about 3 weeks so we will be using Mr. Coffee in the meantime to fill the void.\\n\\nHonestly we are expecting the 3rd machine to eventually break, which is a shame because this is a great machine when it works. It\\'s hard to go back to Mr. Coffee that we are willing to put up with this product as long as the warranty covers replacements but I do not recommend this product.\\n\\nI think alot of the positive reviews are from users who may not have come back to update their initial 4/5 star reviews.\\n\\nPlease try googling \"Vertuo Plus leaking\" as well.Frother worked on 2x even after customer support . I love the nespresso machine but am very disappointed that the frother doesn’t work. It was awesome the first 2 times I used.I absolutely love itThis espresso maker is amazing! It was a gift for my husband. He says he loves it more then his iPhone. The coffee is delicious. The milk aerator makes this deluxe version a hit. We use it for hot chocolate, as well. Highly recommend.Outstanding blending and taste for every cup. Better taste and much more cost effective than the big retail shops. My best purchase in 2021.Nice addition to my counter top, fast & easy making coffee or espresso anytime during the dayWhen the machine decides to work and make coffee, the coffee is great. The problem is it often doesn’t work and I have to unplug and reset daily before I get any coffee out of it. Super annoying when your trying to rush out the house for work.I got the refurbished one for around $120, which is half the price of the brand new unit. I was a little nervous but the machine came without a single scratch or dent. 10/10 reccomend!Great machine that is really easy to use! Happy medium between a basic coffee maker and a professional setup.\\n\\nThe frother is a game changer! My wife and I stopped going to Starbucks after getting our Nespresso!\\n\\n*if purchasing, also pickup descaling solution since the machine will stop working/ The taste of the coffee is affected)The are some many flavors and super easy to use.Good luck getting Vertuoline coffee anywhere else except Amazon. Your local big box stores don\\'t carry it. What\\'s Vertuoline coffee you ask? Well, it\\'s these newer giant pods from Nespresso. When I bought this machine, I should have better educated myself, because these things are both rare and expensive comparably to K-Cups etc.\\n\\nThe good is that the coffee it does produce is excellent. Tastes good, high caffeine (if that\\'s what you\\'re into) and just works. It expels the pod neatly into it\\'s little trash bin behind it, which is good for an office setting like ours. It also heats up relatively quickly compared to Kcup machines we\\'ve had in the past. It also uses aluminum pods, which for those BPA-phobic out there, I\\'m sure is a very good thing and perhaps worth the premium. Machine also looks good, is easy to clean, and works perhaps too simply, literally it\\'s so simple that people get confused operating it.\\n\\nThe bad is expensive pods that are hard to find. Also we still haven\\'t figured out how to get it to dispense just hot water for tea, hot cocoa, etc. When we do, it goes into \"cleaning\" mode and dispenses pretty much all the hot water.\\n\\nAnyways, we got the machine on sale, it makes good tasting coffee so it\\'s worth it for some. I wouldn\\'t buy it again or necessarily recommend it for the simple reason you\\'re locked into their rare Vertuo line crapola. If this somehow becomes as mainstream as Kcups, then cool, but I\\'ve seen no sign of that and quite honestly the opposite. For the price of the Vertuo line pods, you\\'re pretty close to a cup at McDonalds/Sbux to begin with, so it\\'s hard to justify the expense.Love this machine! Love that I can enjoy my coffee at home & spend this on coffee shops. It makes foamy great coffee! It does only make a cup of coffee at a time but that’s usually all I drink in the mornings. The milk frother is amazing! It even froths almond milk well! I couldn’t be happier with my purchase!My second machine, it will not be my last!Wow very nice and more what I was expecting\\nOne of the best machine espresso.I can say \" I am guilty of going to dunkin d every single morning for 5 years or so \" Every single day \" Spending no less than 3.46 a day on an extra large cup with turbo - Thats over 100.00 a month - well i have been cured! The coffee this machine makes is amazing - much better flavor than dunkin - sorry guys! I run on Nespresso - all the pods look confusing \" at first \" just pay attention to the oz - I have a measuring cup to measure sizes \" just to be safe \" to not over fill ! If you want powerful but tasteful get the milk frothier \\' you can make your own cream like a pro - I love this machine - best money we spent all year - If I only spend 50.00 on pods - thats already half of what i have been spending for years now. Very happy New Nespresso family member right hereImmediately opened it and read instructions to prep it, made my first coffee and frother for the milk and was delighted with my purchase 💯I love it!!! There\\'s nothing more to say about it, stop reading this and get one, you will love it!!!This coffee maker is Wonderful!! Easy to use, incredible coffee flavor with Nespresso pods!After I tried out my brothers Nespresso virtuo, I knew I had to have one! This is so easy to use, the pods make it so you don’t need to pick your cup size like the keurig does. When you tap the lid, your old pod slides to the back into a container, no remembering to take one out after use! Just dump the container when it’s full. Love it! My favorite part is the foam you get at the top from the brewing process. Yum!I had originally said this pot leaked. It does not leak if running through the weekly cleaning process! I called Nespresso and the representative walked me step-by-step through some trouble shooting. Once we ran an entire container of hot water through, there was no leak. I am so enjoying this espresso maker!.....it\\'s not very hot and cools down rapidly. And after making a cup, it drips. It drips, and it drips. I keep a piece of paper towel on the mug platform so I don\\'t have to keep rinsing it.\\n\\nThat being said, it produces an amazing cup of coffee! The espresso is as good as my $500+ Breville espresso machine with less preparation and clean up even with the dripping. The taste is way better than the Keurig I replaced with it although the Keurig was easier to use.I am transitioning over from a Keurig type of coffee maker to Nespresso. I wanted to see what all the hype was about and all I have to say is that I am not disappointed. So far I\\'m very happy with my purchase. My only mistake was I didn\\'t pick a color, or didn\\'t realize there was another color. I was expecting it to be all black but it\\'s actually black and grey. This mistake is on me though. I was clicking around looking for deals for this one and the other ones I saw were black so when I picked this one I didn\\'t even check. Nonetheless, it\\'s still a great machine and can\\'t wait for that next cup in the morning. You know what screw that, I\\'m gonna drink another cup after this review. Nespresso is life, Nespresso is loveAll in the title.I love my Nespresso! Although a little more pricey, the flavor of the coffee is great!The machine is great, better then any other coffee machine I had before, the main problem I had was with the shipping, box came out really damaged with no care, the water container was damaged and the milk mixer is not working, try to get it replaced and they only offer me a 10% discount, after a few back and forth was able to come to a agreement but was more of a hassle then I wanted for a Christmas gift, over all the machine is greatI bought this machine for my wife after we tried it at my mom\\'s house on Christmas Day 2019.\\nI was not sold on another expensive coffee machine. But the wife really liked it so....\\nAfter a month or two my wife wife was not so into the whipped coffee anymore.\\nIn the meantime I have developed such a love for my daily cappuccino with whipped milk or cream that I can\\'t stop thinking about my Nespresso coffee machine when we are out of town. even on vacation I look forward to getting home so I can enjoy my love (addictive) Nespresso coffee.\\nany way I can get some free pods ????\\nI love my machine and would definitely recommend this purchase for as a gift or for anyone who loves coffee.\\nthanks George !A great kick off to the dayBest buy ever. Nothing compares perfection a cup. The milk frother is the BEST. Kids liv3 making hot chocolate, whipping oak milk, regular milk, cream. Better than Kruig or other brands. Small footprint. LOVE best buy ever.Box came very damaged and scratched up honestly looked like it was opened was expecting it to atleast come inside another box. Because the box was damaged the pods that came with it were all squished and unusable for the amount I paid it shouldn’t have come like this. Haven’t tested it out so hopefully not damaged that it won’t workNothing to dislike.I absolutely love this! Makes having expresso fast and super convenient!!Better than expected!Love the simplicity of using itWOW!! Lord this thing is Amazing.. All the coffee selections are delish and so easy to use and quite. This machine stops us from running to Starbucks every day and believe me 100 percent. This coffee maker makes the same craftsman drinks then any store.I love this machine! My husband and I both work full-time and this saves us so much time and money. The richness and the depth of flavor you get from this coffee is unbelievable. One of the best purchases I have ever made!!Easy to use and I prefer the power open/close method verses the manual locking.I actually got this to make one cup of coffee at a time since I\\'m the only coffee drinker in the house and I\\'m not a fan of Kcups. This makes a much better, richer, creamier cup of coffee. Plus with the frother, home made lattes are a breeze. I can also make cold foam for cold brew coffeeRápida, cómoda y el diabólico y doble expresos son los mejores para los Cubanos!I was served an Odacio coffee from Nespresso when as a guest at a friends home. I had a Nespresso machine delivered to my home that very day. As a result of serving this coffee I have sold at least four machines by referral. We have one in each home and guest cabin. We even take it traveling. Expensive? Yes! Worth it? Heavens yes!I love it. I wish there more flavor pods and better flavors. But it does his job.The best coffee maker ever!I love this espresso machine. I use it everyday and am happy with the taste. I like the espresso pods better than the coffee pods as they have more of a thick, creamy texture and flavor. The 7.7oz coffee seems a little watered down to me. I use the self clean about once a week toavoid clogs and it has worked just fine. I recommend keeping the manual to remember the commands of the functions (e.g push brew 3x\\'s to clean). I appreciate the simplicity of just two buttons however remembering the commands for how to shut the machine down or deep clean before or after a long hiatus is not so easy. No big deal. Overall (*sips morning coffee*) I am happy!Brews great coffee, no more Starbuck runs that\\'s for sure. Makes a delicious cup of coffee!!Love this Nespresso machine. Easy to use and the milk frother makes great Latte\\'s.Great Coffee - easy to useMachine makes great tasting coffee, and espresso. Aeroccino is very poorly designed product. Makes a huge mess every time it’s used. There is 2 fills lines, one for single, and another for double. Even when filled well below the double fill line it still over flows and makes a huge mess. I would expect a better product. No such luck. Maybe Nespresso can outsource whom makes the Aeroccino. The Aeroccino really kills the over all experiences of the machine.Our machine will no longer brew 8 oz; it only brews 16 oz of coffee now. It has worked perfectly, until recently. We went online to try to google how to reset it, etc. and nothing seems to help. Bummed because this has been a great machineReceived the DeLonghi Vertuo Plus machine today. Very well packed AND ready to unpack which is important for me as I have zero hand strength sure to arthritis. First use instructions very clear (tho I did skip to a youtube video for speed). I\\'ve used this product at my daughter\\'s and know what to expect and am not disappointed. QUESTION FOR NESPRESSO: Why can\\'t I register this machine on your website? There is no option to choose Vertuo Plus machine without the Aeroccino Frother?I had an issue with my machine after a few uses and the seller was excellent in resolving my issue.You have to buy this today!!!works perfect,amazing taste.It’s a little priceyBest coffee we\\'ve had in this house! My husband LOVES this machine. Its so easy to use and the coffee is delicious, we no longer spend the daily $20+ in Starbucks. It\\'s worth every penny! Make sure you order the VERTUO LINE PODS!!! They are different than the original Nespresso pods. The trial pod box that came with it was great!! We chose our favorites and ordered them separately. It’s much nicer than the pictures show it to be, the tray is nice heavy chrome And height adjustable. The top of the machine, where you put the pod in, is “automatic” just flick the handle up and it opens on its own. Just a simple little feature I love. Also, my iced americano is better than any drive through coffee. Ha! Just buy it and enjoy making your own versions of gourmet coffee.I tried a few other coffee pots before being totally satisfied. This is my Favorite by far! In my household, I am the only morning coffee drinker. Finally I can enjoy my coffee every morning without the hassle of brewing a large pot and having the best tasting coffee! I used to have a Keurig and after a year of trying to like it, I tossed it into the trash!\\n\\nTry this and you will love it! Thank you Nespresso!So easy to use and clean! Best purchase this year for sure. I love all of the coffees and the nespresso customer service cannot be beat! Just get it! You will wish you bought it sooner!Loved this when we first received it, Now it is leaking all over the counter, I read in other reviews that people had this problem, bought it anyway hoping it would not happen to us. Well it did. I would not buy this brand. (To their credit, Nespresso is sending me a new machine and I will return this one. They pay for shipping, they are not sending me the same machine however.) The coffee is fabulous and i drink decaf everyone seems to like the coffee. Just not the mess it leaves on the counter... :(\\n\\n**update** I have changed this to 4 stars! Nespresso is a wonderful company to work with they sent the new machine so far so good. Coffee is worth it!!**I finally took the plunge and was very skeptical after a terrible experience with a different brand of pod-coffee maker ;) WOW this machine is amazing. the flavor is delicious, it\\'s easy and well thought out. I can\\'t say enough good things. I was a bit worried about the coffee temp as I\\'ve seen some reviews that say the coffee is only lukewarm but that has not been my experience. All of my pours have been piping hot.\\nI\\'ve only had it a week but I\\'m in love. I was paying $4 a day for my coffee habit prior to purchasing this machine so the cost of the pods don\\'t bother me and I really enjoy that there\\'s essentially no clean up. The ease of use is totally worth the need to buy pods. So far, they\\'ve all tasted great as well.Never tried Nespresso before but as a regular \\'Seattle-based\" Espresso drinker, I was looking for something more than a cup of Joe. The \"K\" machine makes a decent cup at home but Nespresso takes it up a notch and is closer in flavor and texture to an upscale coffee shop. Happy with the performance and flavor selection. The only thing I\\'ve noticed that was a bit of a surprise is the temp of the output isn\\'t as hot as I expected. I\\'m not a super-hot coffee person anyway but if you are, you might need to nuke it after. I\\'ve only used it for a couple weeks so far but am loving it.This is such a great machine! Easy to use and great to please everyone at my house, since everyone can choose a size, strength and flavor.\\nVery happy with our purchaseI love good coffee, and I wanted to get one of these for quite some time. While being trapped at home recently I decided to finally get one. This is a really great machine for the money! It doesn\\'t just make coffee (in my opinion) it makes coffee an event!\\n\\nI was also impressed with the eco-friendliness of the pods and the built-in pod chute, so when you\\'re making multiple cups at once it is much easier than a regular espresso machine! Pod sizes totally remove the guesswork and you get a stunning cup of coffee with a generous crema head on the top!\\n\\nOne thing I would like to see is to offer some other beverages like teas or hot chocolate, but they do what they do best and it is done really well!Loved the coffee but was good while it lasted. One year later and the machine won’t even turn on. What a shame.wow, this machine works like a dream! I\\'m used to strong German coffee and usually will drink 4-6 cups in the morning but the Nespresso is so intense that I can survive the day with just 1 cup. I love all the different flavors especially when having guests over! Can highly recommend this machine!I do love this Nespresso machine. It\\'s easy to use. The espresso/coffee options are delicious. This is the second Nespresso machine I have owned. The first was the original machine, which I had for 7 years! Why 3 stars ...\\nWhile it\\'s nice that this machine has the option to make larger cups of coffee, I would send it back if my old one would magically work again. The reason: I like HOT coffee/espresso. It\\'s true the coffee is warm enough (if you want to drink it all immediately), but it\\'s not hot! In other words, if you want to make your coffee, pour it in a to-go mug, load your things in the car and take the trash out, by the time you pull out of your driveway, you will need to drink your coffee all at once if you want it warm at all. I like to linger over my coffee whether I\\'m driving to work or reading on a Saturday morning. Unless you like to linger over lukewarm coffee, this isn\\'t possible. I would absolutely LOVE it if there was a temperature adjustment on this machine. I\\'ve had it 2 weeks and am debating about whether or not I want to return it. Sadly, I have spent an exorbitant amount of time researching a better, convenient option. I\\'m not sure what I will do at this point.The product is amazing!\\nThe best coffee I\\'ve tasted outside of France; no, I haven\\'t been to Italy.\\nI endorse support the product. *****/*****\\nThe \" Like New\" rating was not like new. The box was nearly shredded and barely held together with nearly an entire role of packing tape, terrifying. The package of tester capsules was half used. The machine had water spots on all components and coffee grounds in disposal tank and capsule inputs slot. It was obvious that the only cleaning done was a paper towel over the outside of the machine.\\nThat being said: I washed it; I sanitized it; and it works perfectly.I am very upset that afte,r INVESTING in pods and purchasing this machine, I am having to return it. The ejection function did not work the ONE time I used it, and it randomly leaked on my kitchen counter. After I sat down with my very mediocre cup of \"coffee\", I heard the machine make a noise akin to a semi after it stops. I went out to see that it was slowly dripping water onto my counter. I am very disappointed. I ended up ordering the exact same machine that I have at work (which uses *much* cheaper pods).Put it this way...if they made a backpack for this thing, I would buy it and take my Nespresso everywhere I go. To the office, camping, grandma’s house, you name it. Oh wait, I already do that.\\n\\nBut seriously, this machine makes some great espresso. Not as good as my friend’s $600 Breville auto grinder, but close enough without breaking the bank. I haven’t been as impressed with the flavor of the coffee sized pods, but the espresso and double espressos are fantastic. The coffees taste more like a regular Keurig, although maybe a little more flavorful. If I’m making coffee for 2 or more, I’ll do pour over, because it’s just better and not particularly messy. But when it’s latte time, this baby gets the nod. I do appreciate having the sizing options for coffee, and I’ll use them when I’m in a rush. Either way, this machine really gets me excited for the morning.I ordered this for my son and daughter in law. They came to my house and had it here. They went home and all they talked about how much they pay for a cup of coffee out and this is so much better.I love this machine. Yes, the water tank leaks and it is annoying but I solved it by simply taking it off and setting it to the side of the machine. I know it\\'s not conventional but there are very simple solutions to this problem. Aside from that, I\\'ve never had a problem with this machine. Immediately when you see the packaging, you know it\\'s quality. Everything is beautifully packaged and the instructions are incredibly easy. Setting it up is also pain free and does not take long at all. It really is a beautiful machine. The motorized lid is amazing and the way that it automatically dispenses the capsule into the back bin is so convenient and elegant. I got mine in black and it\\'s such a pretty sight. The milk frother is truly a thing on its own though. I get perfect, warmed, frothy milk in just a few minutes. I even use it to make hot chocolate and it feels like it was home-made on a stove. All in all, this is such an elegant machine that provides excellent hot coffee. And considering that it comes with the assortment, you can find the perfect strength and flavor that is right for you.The machine is great and it makes great coffee. My advice is to skip this frother and find a better one for the price. The magnetic impeller doesn\\'t stay in place very well, so making a mocha is terribly difficult.Bought in 2020 and used it for about 6 months. Regular descaling and very light use. I ran maybe 100 pods through it and now it only makes about half a cup that\\'s filled with coffee grounds. Customer support sucks and it was too late to return it. Now I have a $250 paperweight on my kitchen counter. Real shame as the machine is nice when it worked.Best investment by far for home coffeeI have had friends I love these machines! I was so excited to get one for it to only come broken. Bought it new, came packaged and safe. The machine does not seem to be able to pull or pump the water from the reserves into the machine. Trying to exchange is impossible. Unable to get the same machine without laying way more than I had, really bummed!It’s a great first time Nespresso! Price was good , and It seems to work well.\\nI do think my sons machine spins a little faster then this one.\\nFor a first time owner of a Nespresso I am pleasedThe manual is very vague and little is in English. Go on YouTube and they will walk you thrust..filling, emptying, descaling, making coffee etc and little tips and tricks.Not so tastyPlay Video\\n My friend bought this a few weeks ago and hasn’t stopped talking about how great her coffee is...so, of course, I had to try it...she doesn’t share. She’s right. The coffee is wow. You get samples ( small samples) of the various types of coffee they offer so that you have some idea of which ones to order.\\nIt is the easiest machine to use, looks great on my counter, and the coffee is delicious. I also love the fact that there is that real European coffee machine foam on top of every cup.\\nYou press the lever,it opens by itself and tosses the used pod in a container attached at the back ( they will send you prepaid mailers to return and recycle the pods). Put in a new pod, touch the lever, it closes, touch the solid green light on top...and Voila, great coffee !I like good coffee. I’m also 67, retired, and cranky. I’ve made good coffee using pour over (kalita and hario), French press, aero press, immersion, and auto drip (technivorm and baratza grinder). These days I want convenience as well as good coffee. I tried a Keurig for awhile. It was pretty finicky. Finding a keurig that didn’t make coffee that tasted like burnt plastic wasn’t easy. I’ve had an older nespresso machine, and liked their espresso. Decided to finally try their newer combo machines. I’m very impressed. Very easy to use, and the coffee and espresso are very good. Lots of choices with regard to drink sizes and roast strength.\\n\\nSome things to consider.....when you buy this machine, you must use nespresso capsules. Capsules are easy to get on Amazon, or you can order them directly from Nespresso. The cost per cup, compared to other methods of preparation, is high. To me, it’s worth it. Only you can make that decision for yourself.Was a great Christmas present!It works great. Doesn’t leak like the other brand**Old Review**: Purchased this machine on 3/22/2020 and by June 2020 it was no longer working and leaking excessively. I presented the issue to Amazon and they blew me off. Nespresso company offered to send me a box to send them the broken machine to fix, which was nice, but not having a coffee machine for several weeks/months doesn’t fix the issue. Purchasing this product was discouraging and I don’t recommend.\\n**New Review Dated 7/28/2020**: I gave this a 1 star review a few weeks ago. I contacted Nespresso company and they immediately sent me a box and fixed the machine and sent it back within a reasonable amount of time, which deserves a better review for resolving the issue with competency.The use of more plastic and a smaller water tank made it want to tip when using a wide big cup. Luckily the old bigger tank still fits and has helped this problem.Would buy again.It turned out I like the Melozio blend best but have to buy a variety package from Amazon, for a reasonable cost.\\nI bought my machine in February 2020 using it once a day. By June it was leaking coffee on my stone counter top. Thought I didn’t have connections aligned properly, but no, after calling support discovered it was clogged even though I was getting a full cup each day. Over the phone the very nice support walked me through the cleaning process as a troubleshooting measure. It was resolved by cleaning.I fill my mug with water and heat it in the microwave. I do not like this extra step. Otherwise, the machine is easy to use. I realize this is a review of the machine, but I can’t comment on the machine independent of the coffee. The quality of the coffee is surprisingly excellent. I buy beans from small roasters, so good quality coffee is a must. The Nespresso pods are comparable. Being able to recycle the pods sealed it for me.Not a coffee snob but I know what I like. Had a decaf at a restaurant in Kittery Maine a month ago and it was outstanding. Asked what it was and they showed me this device. Never heard of this. Thought most of these units were overpriced and really didn\\'t want to go with the foamer/frother; been there, done that, PITA (pain in the....).\\nHeard stuff about leaks, coffee not being hot enough.\\nNo leaks.\\nWorks perfectly.\\nI pre-heat my cup anyway.\\nCoffee (i drink decaf exclusively) is terrific. wow.\\nwish they had a few larger sized decaf intensa offerings.I’ll start by saying that I bought a used model, totaling expecting an item had been used. I saw the the condition described was “very good” and the box was damaged. I received the box and noticed that it appeared to have been previously opened and was taped shut. I open the box and noticed that the machine still had what appeared to be the factory wrap on it still. There were no cosmetic issues with it. I filled the reservoir with water and ran an initial startup cycle. I brewed one of the sample packs of double espresso, which tasted great and was plenty strong. I then unboxed the included milk frother and noticed it was missing the lid. I contacted amazon and they provided assistance reaching out to Nespresso in order to get a replacement lid. I will find out soon how that works out. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and am excited about brewing some coffee and espresso.I love this product I don\\'t know why I waited so long to get onePackaging was busted up. Machine was disgusting. Filthy with coffee stains and finger prints. Found an old used pod. Absolutely disgusting!! To top it of, if that wasn\\'t bad enough, it didn\\'t even work. Very dissatisfied and disappointed!!! I ordered a new machine not a used one. However, even if I would have ordered a used one this is still a disgusting experience. Now, I\\'m having to send pictures because they want pictures. Im glad I took a few. Which I sent to the email. Unprofessional and unacceptable!! Hace los cafés muy buenos y los martes y capuchinos!I have had this for a little while and have only been to Starbucks once since I got it - I had been going about three times a week before. I honestly prefer this over coffee shops now!If you love your Starbucks like I do I highly recommend spending the money on this instead. I was getting an iced caramel macchiato 4-5 days a week and my bank account was showing it. This machine makes it so easy to make one at home along with so many other drink options. I have used keurig for years before this and I am disgusted in myself that I ever thought that was coffee. Yes you will have to throw a handful of money at this machine right away but the prices you will spend to make your coffee at home instead of the drive thru is dramatically lower over the long run. Absolutely love this machine and the coffee/espresso it produces!They said, \"It was the best tasting coffee ever; Better then StarSucks\" Almost everyone in the family owns one these beauties. I get so many compliments on this coffee that everyone asks about this coffee machine.This model has some annoying design flaws:\\n\\n-- There is a variable delay after pressing the brew button without any visual indication that the button press got things started. So you\\'re left wondering if you pressed the button hard enough, or maybe need to press it twice just in case.. until the coffee starts.\\n\\n-- Sometimes the pods get stuck on the rails while sliding back into the pod container.\\n\\n-- The pod container is solid black and can\\'t see what\\'s inside, until it\\'s completely full and it is overflowing.\\n\\nNow after about 6 months it started leaking somewhere internally and won\\'t turn on anymore.\\n\\nI see much better reviews on the older model Vertuo Evoluo (ENV135GY). That one has a transparent pod container on the side. I\\'m going to try that model as a replacement.\\n\\nNespresso needs to make better machines. Nespresso Vertuo produces a superior tasting coffee compared to Keurig, but unfortunately the new Keurig K-Supreme Plus blows this away in quality, features, and overall design.This is a great machine. It makes my espresso daily my wife coffee and decaf. I appreciate that it automatically detects whatever type of pod is inserted and adjusts the water accordingly. The used pods are recyclable, so we just bag them up and send them back to the manufacturer (free postage), so this product generates no trash beyond the packaging it ships in. It’s easy to clean and maintain; we’ve had no problems in 8 months of daily use.\\n\\nThe pods cost about 85 cents each, which is a little more than the grounds for a conventional espresso machine, but it takes no time to prepare or clean up. We’re all busy, and no one wants to spend three minutes washing coffee grounds out of all the crevices of their machine. This simplicity, speed, and cleanliness makes the Nespresso a great value.I got this for my husband for Christmas! It’s almost like having your own Starbucks at home. Amazing product!!The only difference between this machine and the $500 coffee maker is that the coffee isn\\'t ”freshly” grounded right before your cup of coffee. That\\'s it.\\n\\nSave your self the time and money. The expensive coffee machine gives you the feeling of making a better expresso coffee but you really aren\\'t. Nespresso capsules are actually very fresh and sealed in aluminum for freshness so Dont mix it up with the k cups, which are in plastic. The freshness and the brew of this coffee maker is side by side with the $500+ coffee machines.\\n\\nExcept this is much easier and faster to use. They took a $500+ coffee machine, made it simple and faster to use with coffee ready to go in capsules with the perfect size of coffee printed on the barcode on the capsules themselves. And made the whole machine affordable to everyone.You have to ask yourself... Do you feel lucky? It seems that the seals on some of these that fit the top of the coffee pod randomly go hard and crack letting the coffee escape as the pod is spun. You\\'ll know if you\\'re one of the unlucky few if you start getting coffee down the back of the machine and all over your counter. If you\\'re really unlucky like me, it will be just out of warranty and they\\'ll want $125 to fix it or they\\'ll give you a discount on a new one after accusing you of being the problem because you didn\\'t clean the machine ONCE A WEEK. Who does that?. In any case, neither is really an acceptable solution to what is definitely a design flaw. My old Tossimo worked for 11 years and I only switched to this machine because I couldn\\'t find the pods for that one anywhere anymore. So, my recommendation is to run in the other direction. Buy a different model, buy a Keurig, buy a drip coffee maker... Or if you\\'re feeling lucky, roll the dice. I wish you luck!\\n\\nUpdate: I liked the coffee enough that we rolled the dice and bought a new Virtuoline Next machine. This machine is engineered MUCH BETTER. They basically gave-up on trying to stop the system from leaking and just engineered the new machine to manage the leaks. Now, any leaking flows into a little cup under the spent pod storage. So, even if the machine leaks, at least it won\\'t get all over your counter like the VirtuoPlus machines do. Basically, in my mind, this is an admission that the VirtuoPlus machines have a major leak issue, and their refusal to acknowledge this or address it a few months past the warranty is poor business. Run away from this particular model. Buy a VirtuoNext. You\\'ll lose the motorized lid, but you won\\'t miss it, and you\\'ll save yourself a ton of mess and money when the machine inevitably starts leaking.Called Amazon they directed to Nespresso…stood on the phone for 45 minutes with the tech. It worked for one serving and it stopped working again. Spent a lot money on this. They didn’t offer to replace. Don’t waste your money.Very easy to use! The milk frother is the star of the show!! Works so well and is so easy to use and really elevates the cappuccino experience! Didn’t realize this came with a variety pack of coffee pods so that was a fun surprise that we got to try a variety of coffee types! Interesting that it senses the size of the coffee/espresso pod that you insert. So there are bigger vertuo pods for coffee and smaller for espresso. Also be careful when buying pods, the vertuo pods are different than some of the other Nespresso machines.I\\'ve have a keurig but the coffee always tasted watery and just not at all like cafe style coffee. I even bought a make-your-own-k-cup so I could use better quality coffee and it still did not make good coffee. This Nespresso machine is pure magic! The coffee is amazing!\\n\\nThe Nespresso machine has excellent coffee capsules and works way better than any keurig I\\'ve ever used. It even came with like sampler 10 pack of capsules to try their popular flavors. I bought the red machine only version (if you were curious). No issues so far but I\\'ll update if anything comes up.We used one a family member had and loved it, so we got one for ourselves. It is awesome - makes great coffee and love that we can make one cup. The frothiness is something we really likeThere’s not much more to say other than that this machine is one of my favorite things in the house. The only reason why you shouldn’t buy this one is because they have a slightly newer one with slightly more capabilities, but I’m not sure of the price difference (that one’s called the Vertuo Next). If you’re thinking about buying this, get it. If you think they’re expensive, they’re not. Each coffee is around $1. By the end of the year, you’ve saved money if you include the price of the machine. Simply buy it, love it, and never look back.I didn\\'t need this but for the $99 bundle, had to try it. Not that impressed with how the gray color looks but LOVE everything else about it. Came with a nice intro variety of esp., dbl esp., lungo and coffee size capsules. I HATE being told by Nespresso these are the only choices I have and this is the size you must have but overall, I love it. Feel very special drinking it. Really nice! Ironically I still need to keep my Nespresso original because I love the Starbucks Espresso made for it. But I cannot get them for this one:( Still need the k-cup pot for my other favorite coffees but dang, 3 machines take up a lot of room!Very easy to use, and so much quieter than our older nespresso. Only drawback is the increased cost of pods.This is a great machine. Easy to you and brews the best coffee and espresso. I never considered myself a coffee snob until now.The BEST coffee machine….until it stops working. I purchased this march 2020, and it worked great until about 2 weeks ago. Now the machine is leaking and the frother whisk quit spinning. After calling Nespresso they said the warranty is 1 year. Being such an expensive machine, I would expect it to last a few years at least.Bought this for my wife in 2019 at christmas and she has used it EVERY DAY since. She was an avid coffee shop visitor and now she makes 3-4 cups for the same price as 1 coffee shop cup. Plus Nespresso comes out with new flavors pretty frequently so it\\'s never the old cup of coffee. The free recycling return bags are a great perk.\\nFor those mornings a demon seems to have possessed a person. You can load a pod ,place cup underneath and have a fresh cup with about 1 minute to exorcise that demon pretty quickly.I love this machine so much! My friend kept on insisting that I buy it because she loved hers so much and just knew I would too. I don\\'t even give a second look to Starbucks or other coffee shops. I make my own lattes and caramel macchiatos! I brought my machine to work because everyone was giving me a hard time about being a coffee snob now. After I made them lattes and cappuccinos, we ended up buying a machine for the office employees LOL....however, arrived opened missing half of the pods and the discount gift certificate. Probably not Nespresso\\'s fault but rather Amazon\\'s warehouse and/or delivery process. And I was at home at the time of delivery to the door. Annoying but not necessarily a show stopper.For the average coffee drinker, Nespresso hits the mark. Quality machine. Coffee tastes good, but when it comes to espressos, not there. The crema or foam is artificially created through a centrifugal process.Everything was going well for this machine for us.. now after 3yrs it\\'s leaking .. wow.. coffee is spilling out of the machine while we were making a cup. Sad..I was really in love with this machine - for the first few months, that is. Then the frother stop foaming the milk. It will still warm it, but it is just liquid. I rinse it out after each use, so as not to clog. It has never been in the dishwasher...always washed by hand. What is the deal. This was not a cheap set up!The machine itself is awesome, however I returned this color because it is not as pictured and not as nice quality\\nI ordered the black one and returned this one, for the following differences:\\nBlack has actual chrome - heavier pieces and nicer quality than the grey plastic\\nBlack was shipped the bigger water capacity tank, the grey, although it stated same, was shipped with smaller capacity\\nBlack has a better ON button with chrome where the grey one had plastic.\\n\\nThe overall quality of the grey was not consistent with the online description, nor as good of quality components. I suspect the red would be similar to the grey quality.There is absolutely nothing about this machine I don’t like. Not only does the Nespresso coffee taste fabulous but the machine makes it rich and creamy with the little bit of froth on it. I had a Keurig machine for years I far prefer the Nespresso machine. The milk frother heats the milk up perfectly. It times itself and froths it like a pro. It’s perfect. I’ve made regular cups of coffee and I’ve made espresso drinks and they both turned out fabulous. I highly recommend this machine.It took me ages to get a coffee maker. I first bought a very Expensive Nespresso, It was so not worth the price so took it back. After reading many reviews I decided on this one.. Looks great and doesn\\'t take up too much space. coffee always tastes deliciuos and easy to use.I love the product but after not even a year the frothier has broken and machine has been blinking red even after following descaling instructionsThe coffees and espressos from this machine are light years better than any competitor.I’ve always wanted a big espresso machine but they’re extremely expensive. I went to a friends house and she showed me her nespresso machine and had me a cup of coffee. The coffee flavor was out of this world! The variety of coffees are amazing and tastes so wonderful. Needless to say I got myself one and my husband and I absolutely love it!! We’ve not purchased coffee at Starbucks or elsewhere since! It’s better than the coffee shops.The coffee and espresso is delicious, lots of variety to choose from. Various sizes and you can choose how much water comes thru if you want or let it go automatic of course.\\nMy machine unfortunately stopped working after 40 days, but Nespresso was easy to work with and sent me packaging to send my unit in for repair. I believe the button mechanism is what will need replacing, it stopped clicking and went \"soft,\" and the machine wouldn\\'t send water thru anymore.\\n\\nThe frother is AMAZING. love it, it is so quick and even non dairy milks work great.Very good except for the pods being a little expensive. The flavor is super.It\\'s perfect works great comes out hot perfect blendedIn my opinion, the Nespresso is the best coffee around and when my older machine stopped working, I quickly purchased another.\\nI’d have given it 5 stars across the board if not for the horrible shape the box was in and the fact that it looked as though someone sent me a used box and machine.\\nYou can see by the photos what sort of shape the insides were in too. To top it off there was no manual. Luckily I still had the manual from my old machine.\\nIf it wasn’t for the fact that even one day without my Nespresso was not something I wanted to endure, I would have sent this mess back.\\nMy advice would be to choose the brown box option when ordering. Maybe it would be better protected.\\nI also am writing this review as documentation should the machine break or stop working due to the horrible condition it arrived in.Heard great things about Nespresso and it has lived up to the hype, so far. So glad I bought the bundle with the milk frother. It is quite simply fantastic! Froths the milk like a professional barista! Really enjoying the variety of flavors of espresso and coffee; and I love making my own fabulous vanilla or pistachio lattes! Machine is easy to use and has a small footprint on the counter. A winner!!The first machine I ordered leaked at the water canister. I called Nespresso customer service. They were polite and truly cared about my issue. I received the replacement machine within two weeks. I have been using the replacement machine for several months no issues.While other brands of single serve coffee maker have none little to improve their technology Nespresso has taken a quantum leap forward..\\n\\n-The machine is much quieter\\n\\n-One touch to warm up (fast) and brew\\n\\n-Completely customizable cup volume from 2 through 14 oz (a basic idea lost on Caffitaly or Starbucks)\\n\\n(btw I would not pay more for the ALTO 14 oz pods - the more intense regular sizes seem to stretch to 12 oz + and still give you a great cup.)\\n\\n-Water tank you can grip in one hand, lift off, and refill easily\\n\\n-One touch powered mechanism to drop a pod in\\n\\n-Used pod box you can lift out with one finger and empty\\n\\n- ALL THE WATER ENDS UP IN YOUR CUP - none in the pod box, or anywhere else.\\n\\n- The coffee is pretty good too - $1.1 per cup - worth it for the convenience imho\\n\\nNo TEA capsules yet - hopefully soonMachine works great however upon revisiting this page (to share the link with a friend), I realized that the package I received was missing a piece (the small stand the cut is supposed to be placed on). Disappointing since after each cup is brewed the machine still drips a little and stains my counter so I have to keep a tissue there. Would be great if I had that stand to catch the drip.finally...many years ago I could only find Nespresso in Europe and I fell in love with the machines but always hesitated at changing the EU plugs for this machine. These machines were probably in a random online shopping cart of mine over 15 times but never purchased. Finally I pushed the purchase button after seeing 200 George Clooney commercials (not really). I always wanted thius coffee line when introduced as I simply didn\\'t want espresso all the time. ...Amazing and finally I am having this taste again....No leaks on my end as some reviewers stated...but if you get one that does Amazon will always take care of you. Although the pods can be a little expensive you have to look at the whole picture if you are a Starbucks daily shopper monetarily wise. I love Starbucks , don\\'t get me wrong but I want this at home and when I want it. I have a Keurig as well which I self-fill with fresh ground Sumantran but Nespresso kicks its K-Kup butt for satisfaction.Received my Nepresso machine and the box looked like it had been returned before. Very taped up. I was missing the adjustable cup support. The instructions were for different model then was sent.Thought I was buying twin to same set I bought at a store. The materials this set is made from is clearly cheaper. More plastic parts...no wonder it was less $$$ than store. The aeroccino isn’t the same quality either. It’s lid doesn’t fit as snug. It works fine but doesn’t feel as solid or that it will last as long. Bought for use in seasonal home.Its been a great investment to our household. We were constantly going to Starbuck for coffee and ever since i got this machine we have saved ourselves some bucks. Yea, it might seem in the beginning like this\\nMachine and its coffee is expensive but in our house its 3 of us and in the long run we actually save.. anyway, it works great, very easy and simple to use. Makes great espressos and coffees. Ive tried most of their coffees and almost like them all.It was louder than I thought it would be when brewing coffee so I had to put it on a thick non-slip mat to decrease the vibration on my counter or it would wake people up. The coffee pods are expensive but the coffee is wonderful- flavorful, aromatic and with a perfect foam on top.In terms of convenience and flavor this is great, but it started leaking just outside of warranty period. Would expect from a $50 coffee maker, not $150+.This expensive item was shipped by Amazon in it\\'s original case with all the details/four color pictures of what\\'s inside!!!!\\nBad enough packages are always at risk of disappearing...why invite thieves with such an inviting billboard? I would recommend you present an offer, on the check out screen, to put such orders in non descript shipper as you did for a relatively inexpensive metal storage rack I purchased a while back.\\nSeems like a no brainer to me. Please consider.I’ve had this machine for a year. It is glitchy in the cleaning and descaling process. It went into descaling mode two months after its first descaling. It won’t run through the descaling and rinsing mode according to the directions. It’s been more trouble than worth for espresso less good than my old stovetop espresso pot. Not worth the money nor the hassle.It was working well. Needed to be cleaned so we cleaned it. And it still wasn’t working well. Would only let a small amount of coffee out of the machine at a time and won’t give us a full cup.This thing is amazing! I’ve used it every day for the last month. Have not had any issues. Stopped using my plain old coffee maker now that I have this. Each coffee pod cost around one dollar which is relatively cheap so I’m not sure what people are talking about when they say the pods are expensive because a bag of ground coffee would essentially end up costing you about the same thing for how many cups of coffee you get out of it.Very impressed with the quality in such a small machine. Although the first one was defective and we got a replacement, it was worth the wait!\\nI bought this for the office and everyone enjoys a hot coffee or a shot of espresso every morning before we all start our day. This definitely replaced all the coffee we buy everyday that are expensive. Good investment to save money\\n\\nNow I’m thinking of buying the same machine at home to use during my day offs.it took about 45 minutes to get 1st coffee cup perked, i can\\'t seam to figure out why, but it tasted amazing once i got it to brew. i pushed the button as directed every time so not sure it would not work, until it did wqork, hopefully it will work the 1zst time in the morningI was really excited to receive this espresso maker. I made my first espresso and I couldn’t see the cup filling up but after a few seconds I noticed that all the coffee was being dispensed from the bottom of the machine. I’m not taking about a small leakage here, the entire cup of coffee came from the bottom. I tried again just to see make sure that it’s actually a flawed machine and the second time also the same thing happened. Sadly, I have to return it.For the longest time I was faithful to my Keurig until my manager bought one of the for our office this past Christmas. I was reluctant to try it because I have food allergies but when I eventually did, I could not go back to K-cups. The flavor is an improvement, the caffeine is more potent, and the cream doesn\\'t irritate your stomach. I bought this for my home to replace my Keurig and I do not regret that decision for a second. My wife enjoys the foam that some of the capsules provide as a finishing touch. I could recommend this Nespresso more and it\\'s a must buy.Works great. Easy to prep for use. Brews quickly.This product is easy set up and easy to use! Love the coffee as well!!The entire cup is foam. I have to eat it sit for the foam to go away, then my coffee is cold. It wasn\\'t like this at first.Began leaking after 3 months. This seller, East Coast Liquidators was completely unhelpful & unresponsive. Would not repair, replace or refund any amount.Perfect. All that we expectedReceived item and it strongly smelled like weed and stunk up my hole house. Neighbor has same complain about package delivered minutes before by the same driver. Extremely ridiculousIs it to assemble an easy to use awesome producthis was gift to child don\\'t know how it works.I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my wife. We both absolutely love the flavor of all the pods it came with and its ease of use. The milk frother is an awesome feature also. The only down fall would be the cost of the replacement pods and the fact that most stores do not carry them. With that said, still as good or better and less expensive then Starbucks... Yes ... I said it...I have been wanting an espresso maker for a while, and I\\'m super glad I splurged a little and got this one! It\\'s very easy to use, takes very little time to heat up the water and make my espresso. It can also be used for regular cups of coffee as well. The store bought pods are little pricy, but you can always buy a refillable pod. Totally recommend this!I am absolutely obsessed with this machine in fact I want to give it its own little special place in the house! The coffee is absolutely delicious and the milk frothier is so quiet and easy to use. The entire set up is just simple and efficient. I’m highly impressed and it is the best $200 that I have spent in a long time!Fast. Quiet. Queda demasiado este café ♥️♥️♥️We loved our Nespresso Vertuo machine for a year and some change. But then it gave us the solid red light of death in the middle of a descaling session. Support couldn’t help and all the online chatter points to this being a problems for many Vertuo owners. I’m sad because I love the coffee and thought it was saving me money…but not if I have to replace it every 1.5 years.This is the second time I bought this machine and it broke just stopped working .Guys, I have to tell you! This is a must have! You need it! Omg, the energy I get after drinking coffee it’s out of this world! I don’t even like Starbucks anymore , seriously! It saves me money but it’s so so good! I wanna drink coffee all day, love it!This was my first “like new” purchase. It came in the original packaging and clean. The only thing that I could complain about is that some of the free pods that came with it were missing but I did not think it was a big deal. It also makes the best coffee! I could never go back to having a keurig.\\nTip: you can order pods from nespresso and get free recycling bags with postage on them so nespresso can recycle them.I’m a huge coffee lover having multiple cups a day every day. This has been the best investment I’ve made. I’ve had a standard drip coffee maker, a Keurig, and a Ninja Coffee maker and this one is far and beyond better. The flavor and depth of the coffee is amazing and as a black coffee lover this is much more robust and flavorful. Most regular drip coffee makers can’t hold a candle to the Nespresso. I’ve also enjoyed the aeroccino machine for both hot and cold foam milk when I’m feeling fancy. I highly recommend this machine.Love it!!I’ve had an original Nespresso machine for years, got this as a gift for my office but I like this so much better that I’m keeping it for home and taking the old one to work.\\nI think the Nespresso pods are the best pod coffee, both the original and the vertuoplus, and I like that they’re metal, not plastic being subjected to heat as with Keureig pods. There are tips, such as run 1 cup of water first to ensure it’s hot enough. It’s really about the coffee as a good machine with bad coffee makes bad coffee and for the price, this is great.I’ve had a keurig for years and enjoyed it. However, after trying a coffee at a friends house with her nespresso I knew I had to have one. The flavor, taste, and overall quality is like no other. I’ve now had this for two months and every morning after my first sip I thank the coffee heavens I made the switch!! If you’re thinking about getting one I highly recommend it. You won’t regret it!We had several Keurig machines before we bought this one. The keurig is fast but had poor coffee flavor. The Nespresso has far and above the best coffee flavor when compared to the keurig. The only downside is the coffee is more expensive and as we enjoy it more, we have needed to purchase more coffee. We give this machine 5 thumbs up.I had used the previous model for about 3 years making about 2 cups of coffee a day before it broke down. I order the latest model and after about 10 cups of coffee, the lid locked up with a red error light and the coffee make broke down. Hopefully this is a a one off defect and the my replacement being shipped will last me for years. Have my fingers crossed.This machine makes great espresso, but not a geat cup of coffee. When brewing a 7.7 oz pod you end up with a full cup of espresso. I went back to my Ninja coffe maker, but use the Nespresso when I want a nice cappuccino or latte. The frother works great and is quick and simple. I use it to make hot chocolate sometimes. Pods are expensive so I use my Ninja for coffee in the morning and have a cappuccino from my Nespresso. The Nespresso heats up quick and is easy to use. Still trying other drinks.If you are tired of the water down coffees buy this. It’s pure magic of flavor, body and aroma.Bought this for Christmas in December 2021, it lasted for 5 months. I saw similar reviews and was hoping there was just a defective few but nope! Same descaling situation as everyone else. I used every descaler on the market from Nespresso, etc. Just flashes red and shuts off. Worked great the first month, noticed less crema and the flavor was lackluster as the months went on, then it just died. I heard their warranty was good so I reached out via email, never heard back. It’s been a month now since reaching out. Basically, even tho Keurig isn’t as fancy, I’d go with that at this rate. Paying for a supposedly great Nespresso machine, paying over the top for hard to find pods, for it to last only 5 months and EVERYONE is having similar issues? Yeah, not worth it.I bought the machine in used, like new condition. From my understanding this would mean that it was purchased then promptly returned but still in perfect working condition. This was NOT the case. It was missing the Welcome Manual (with a contact number for Nespresso) and the machine is broken. I followed the instructions manual precisely but when I insert a pod and press start it blinks red two times then back to green. According to the manual this can be fixed by ensuring the water is full and checking that the pod is inserted correctly. Both of these things were already happening and it will not work. I’m so irritated that I have to package this huge thing back up and return it.It heats up quickly, is easy to refill, and the coffee is so delicious that every single cup takes me back to the first time I had a great cup of coffee. I also really like that when you return used pods to Nespresso, they compost the coffee and recycle the aluminum. You can get pre-paid envelopes from Nespresso.\\n\\nThe pods are a bit expensive (about $1 a cup) but I feel so much better about using this than K-cups that it seems worth it. Plus, $1 for a cup of delicious, foamy coffee seems reasonable!\\n\\nThe pods themselves are kind of beautiful, so I also got the stand with the glass top with a drawer in it. I purchased this machine in red (who wouldn\\'t want the red!?) because it was cheaper. It\\'s a good-looking machine.You can make coffee just like Starbucks, it’s great.TheNespresso is a great product. It makes a great cup of coffee. The only thing is that there were no directions for the frothed. Still don’t know how to do that.We used to own a Keurig coffee machine which worked out well for the last 4 years. We recently switched to this Nespresso machine because I like the taste of the coffee better and love the crema made on top of the coffee. The only downside to this coffee maker is the pods are not readily available in your standard grocery store and can only be purchased online or at a Nespresso store, which is about 45 minutes away from me. I just have to plan well and order my coffee online before I run out. Otherwise, love this machine, love the coffee and love the aeroccino to froth my milk!It can make from an espresso to a large coffee. I prefer Intenso for a strong cup. However there are plenty of choices in capsules in all sizes and strengths. That\\'s the beauty of this machine.I\\'m making the review 7 months after my purchase because my fairly new Nespresso Machine started leaking and when i called costumer service for help, they said I would have to send the machine to be fixed which is good, but I was told it would take 7 to 10 days. It has been 2 weeks and I haven\\'t heard anything about it, so I called and was told that it is now going to take 4 to 6 weeks. This is very disappointing since it was not even a year old machine. I was told that Nespresso offers loaners but for some reason the company said they can\\'t send me one because they have none to give out. I am now left with lots of coffee pods and no machine. Not good costumer service. They actually offered me coffee but i would have to pay for it wow as im telling them i have no machine.Love the built-in disposal bin!Thoroughly enjoy coffee from this machine. Nespresso makes the coffee indulgent and creamy.I discovered this coffee maker at my girlfriends home. Couldn’t get enough, so I ordered this one. It is a great machine. Works perfect. Delivers a great cup of coffee with that yummy crema at the top. I have stopped buying Starbucks!Vertuo Nespresso pods are expensive. They can only be purchased form Nespresso or Amazon( that I know of) Big box stores and grocery stores only carry the \"nespresso original.\"\\nMy only negative is that I like the coffee or espresso to be a little hotter.This machine makes awesome espresso and coffee! I\\'m very pleased with my purchase. The only downside is that it has no real instructions. You drop the pod and press the button... sometimes twice. There\\'s also no indicator to let you know to add water. You have to pay attention to the water levels.Ok for brewing. Hard to understand when cleaning. Rehomed after a couple weeks.Awesome coffee!! Smells incredible. The foam is pretty good most times. Only wish they had reusable pods. I ordered some from a third party let’s see how it goes. The frothed is great but wish it could do cold frothing too like the 4Can not say enough about this company. Superior coffee, AMAZING customer service. Our last machine lasted 6 years being used all day every day.Produces Italian cafe store coffee and espresso every time. Highly recommend as well as their Melozio pods. I normally drink a medium roast coffee and the Melozio is just that. Great coffee taste, but not super strong.Done in a quickyLove this coffee machine! Coffee is hot and so many flavors to choose from. My favorite is iced coffee with the chocolate fudge (with caramel creamer) or caramel cookie (with sweet cream creamer). Buy it. You won’t regret it!Adore this! Had a Keurig that finally died and decided to try this. The coffee is 1000% better although quite a bit more expensive. Still cheaper than a coffee shop. The unit heats up quickly and brews a sublime cup of coffee every time. I would personally like it to be hotter, but that is solved by a quick extra 20 seconds in the microwave. Perfect size to fit in the corner on my counter.Coming from an old Tassimo, I was still addicted to its\\' top flavor. Months later...the smooth ease of its use won me over. Hey, with a heart condition, the half-caff capsules have surprisingly great flavor! It is now my go-to daily brew. The Aerocinno is a latte must. Every coffee lover should own at least that!I now understand the meaning of life.Our holiday gift to ourselves, this is a great machine. It makes the yummiest expresso with the perfect amount of foam. We also bought a milk frother and have been having better specialty drinks at home instead of going to the local coffee chain. The choices of expresso are fun and the machine sits perfectly on the glass topped drawer we also purchased.The good news, Nespresso has the best customer service I have ever experienced. Unfortunately, I have lost faith in this product. I bought this one year ago and loved everything about the coffee! I was thrilled. Four months later it died, but I called customer service and they sent me a new one. Three months later that one broke and they wanted me to send it in for repair but I asked for a new one and they obliged. Five months later that one died. I am waiting for their box to send it in for repair, but this is nuts. Three machines in a year!!!!! I am so bummed. If you do purchase this, open an account with Nespresso on their website so you get the great customer service. Plus, when you buy pods from them directly, they send you free stuff to start and free samples every time, plus you can only get the recycle bags from them directly. Free shipping over $100, scheduled delivery, and you can return unopened packages. I hope they get it together ... but when this one dies, I am done. Good luck.Just received my Nespresso VertuoPlus today, and if my first cup is any indication...superior coffee is used. I had a Keurig previously, and there is no comparison to the creamy flavor of Nespresso coffee. I tried the Elvazio from the included sampler. Very nice. I also love that you can program each pod flavor to your specific needs, so if you want a bigger cup than the pod factory set, you can change it...just keep in mind that more water equal less intensity. Cant wait to try them all, and the enclosed frother too! It heats up very fast, and I love that you can recycle the pods.I toyed with getting this for two years and my only regret is not getting it sooner. The thing is a freaking GAME CHANGER. I’m a health care worker on 7-7 shifts and this thing is my life line. Creamy espresso, taste and texture like a latte but it’s literally just the smoothest espresso disguised as a $5 Starbs. No calories, no dairy, no regrets, no fatigue, no missing out. I know it sounds like I’m sponsored but unfortunately I’m just at the point in my life where I get very excited about things like appliances. I’ll personally write you a hand written apology if you don’t love this thingAmazon had a great \"used, like new\" deal on this Nespresso machine, so I bought myself an early Christmas present. I normally drink a pot of coffee a day. I like coffee. Espresso coffee is a new deal for me, and all I can say is the coffee made by this machine is so-o-o good. It\\'s like drinking coffee-infused liquid silk. So easy to use- just fill the water reservoir, pop in the pod, close the lid and push the \"go\" button on top. Wow! Guilty pleasure- worth a buck a pod. A lot cheaper than buying it at the coffee shop.It’s like having a coffeehouse in my kitchen! I’m able to make hot and iced coffees and even espresso drinks. I’ve cutdown going to Starbucks at least 90% since I bought this machine. Definitely worth the investment!Super easy to use and clean up is even easier!!!A MAZING in one fell swoop we have demolished trips to starbuck$$$$\\nEdit\\n11/29/20\\nIt\\'s been a year, this machine has become the most used appliance in the house. It\\'s easy to use and easy to clean.\\nGot the wife a advent calendar from nespresso and she\\'ll be using it every day for the rest of the year. (She was already planning on that)Excelente Máquina !This machine is amazing.\\n\\nWent to a retail store and same model cost almost double the price in store. It comes with a sample pack of pods, which is a really nice touch.\\n\\nThe instructions were really easy to follow for the to initial “cleaning” before you use it, and minutes after I took it out of the box I made myself a cup of coffee.\\n\\nI’ve used this every day since it arrived, and it’s perfect, wouldn’t change a thing.\\n\\nCoffee lovers, unite! Highly recommend.I\\'m sure the product will be fine just wish it was more presentable since its a house warming gift.I\\'m a coffee addict and a very happy one right nowLoving this espresso machine! Looks sleek and makes quality espresso. Still trying to figure out all the different coffee pods that go with it. It did come with a variety pack in the box. Also got the glass pod drawer to go under machine to keep it organized.Now I just need some cute cups to go with!Everything we hoped for. Makes outstanding coffee and espresso. One of my go-to drinks at Starbucks was an Americano; enjoyed the one this one made even more. The pods feel expensive compared to k-cups but there is no comparison in the quality of the product. If, like me, you start making fewer stops at the coffee shop, it’s well worth it. Ordered pods direct from Nespresso site and had them the next day.ExcellentSo after having the system for 3 months it came to a halt. The red circle came on and the troubleshooting did work. Then two weeks later the red circle returned.\\nNone of the troubleshooting options worked. I spent several hours trying to bring the system back to life.\\nI reached out to Nespresso with no response as to my concerns. Being a pricey purchase and respected company I expected a response from the company. The system is going to the electronic graveyard.\\nWe now have a traditional coffee maker again.First machine kept malfunctioning but Nespresdo customer Service was great. We sent that one back for repair but even after that it malfunctioned so Nespresso sent a new one us extra sleeve of coffee to replace those that were wasted. We are very pleased with the new one...it is operating perfectly.Warning: This will make you rethink your entire life and what you thought good coffee was!! I splurged and bought this and OMG you will never drink a regular cup of coffee again. It is the smoothest most flavorful delicious cup of coffee you will ever drink. Absolute perfection. This coffee maker brews joy not coffee!I bought this machine in April 2019 and have been used it not very often. Recently the machine showed a red light. There was a lot of black water inside the machine when it was placed horizontally on the table. Please don\\'t buy this type of machine because of very bad quality.I got rid of my kieurig and got this. No one in my household can stomach this. All of the pods I’ve tried have been disgusting. I waited hoping it would grow on me but nope. Now it’s too late to return it.I absolutely love this machine! My husband and I were blown away by how good the coffee is and how easy the machine is to use. I also love what nespresso is doing to help the environment. I knocked off a star because the model I bought is in graphite metal so I was expecting it to be metal, not plastic but that has nothing to do with how great this coffee machine is.Coffee tastes great. The base started leaking less than a week after purchase. I have examined the source of the leak and am sure it\\'s the base, not the drip tray and not the water resevoir. I have run a cleaning cycle and rinse cycle, nothing helps. Registered the machine with Nespresso and called for help. Was told that the technical service line was busy and someone would call me back -- never received a call back. I did read reviews of the machine leaking and I\\'m now adding to those reviews. Rating of 2 stars for the great coffee.This was a gift and was exactly what they were wanting. Nice product, however; when it arrived it had NO manual to explain how to use it, AND it was in a box sloppily packaged without proper support to hold it in one place while shipping. I\\'m glad it wasn\\'t broken by the time it got to us.I bought this a year ago - it makes ok coffee / espresso. The coffee has a thick foam on it which I know some people like, but I found black coffee with a thick layer of foam kind of odd. It also takes forever to close the lid. It\\'s automated so when you push it down you have to wait for it to slowly close on its own. And wait. And wait.\\n\\nBut the BIGGEST ISSUE... It now leaks coffee out the back - not water, COFFEE! I have to stuff the machine with paper towels to keep the coffee from running all over my counter and it only brews about half of the cup - the rest spills out of the back into paper towels. It\\'s a mess and I\\'m going to contact the company but if they can\\'t fix it, it\\'s going into the trash.\\n\\nMade OK coffee for a year. 2 stars because it did its job for awhile.\\n\\nDon\\'t buy this one.I really love the flavor of the coffee but like many others here, think it should be hotter. That said, it\\'s no big deal for me to nuke it for 15 seconds before taking it into my office. One taste of Nespresso coffee and my Keurig has permanently lost the place of honor on my counter to Nespresso. I got a terrific deal on this machine from Amazon Warehouse. New except box was damaged. Definitely need to remind myself to look for warehouse deals first. Recommend.Excellent product!!! Definitely recommend!!I used to think coffee was just for old people, but after receiving this and experiencing the variety of flavors I can say with certainty that I was wrong. This machine has a great range of flavors which differ greatly from each other. I highly recommend getting a reliable brother as well for your sweetened cream or milk which adds a great new dimension to your coffee. I used to get $6 dollar coffees from my local shop many times a week, but after buying this I only ever grab one if there is a special and I\\'m out. The quality is extremely high, especially if you are willing to find a great creamer to accompany the coffee.Got this machine for my birthday. I love it very much because it makes all sizes of coffee, not only espresso. I like the variety of flavors to choose from and the easy coffee order and gifts we get from Nespresso. Now, the aerocino frother is worthless. I followed the suggestion of heating up the milk before putting in the frother, but it was too much work. I don’t use it anymore. I just put half and half on our coffee and some sugar free syrup and we are good to go!If you dont have this set, you need to buy one. It is a total life changer for me. The best coffee ive ever had. The cream frother is another life changer for me. I put my vanilla grocery store creamer in this and it turns it into this foamy whipped delight. I love this!It does a great job and the espresso and frother both work well ... BUT they charge you $1.10 per pod which is absolute extortion. I work from home and drink 3 - 5 cups per day Monday - Friday. So the simple math is that this coffee cost me between $780 - $1,300 per year based on 3 - 5 cups per day, with 260 workdays a year.\\n\\nIf you pay $400 more up-front for a real espresso machine with frother, the taste obviously won\\'t be compromised. In fact, you will have a much wider variety of coffee selections and strength options available to you. But more importantly, the coffee will only cost you about $375 per year max for higher end coffee choices - and more cups in a day. So the higher costing machines pay for themselves well within a year, and then the savings goes on for all future years.\\n\\nYou can opt to use the $900+ per year savings on something far more intelligent. That is of course unless you actually like paying well over double what you should for the barely noticeable convenience of a pre-packed pod (takes me 30 seconds). This company is clearly focusing on taking advantage of the sloth and/ or math challenged.Loved this the first three weeks. Then there was a major problem. Called and got a service \"fix\" over the phone. Another week, all was well. Then the identical problem. This was/is obviously defective, right? Called the company again. This time I was on with them for more than an hour with NO satisfaction. They wanted me to send it back, they\\'d check it out, fix it - THE SAME MACHINE - and return it. You know, about one or two months, right? No espresso machine, no replacement... just have their \"technician\" tinker with it. Asked to speak with the supervisor, but because this company call was in the CARRIBEAN, no supervisor was to be found. \"We\\'ll call you back.\" Right. So because this company made its nonexistent service satisfaction known, we just want to get rid of it and purchase elsewhere. So we began the long, arduous process to return to Amazon... and y\\'all know how tricky that can be when it is beyond the 30-day window. But all is well now. This piece of expensive junk is on its way back, we are being refunded and can shop for a replacement, This company (apparently owned by Nestle) gets an F for customer satisfaction, while Amazon gets our Appreciation for taking care of our return and refund.I bought as a gift for my caffeine addicted wife. My wide loves the Nspresso machine, she uses twice daily. The device comes with a sample pack and we also purchased a larger sampler found online. My wife was able to setup and clean the device within 10 mins of opening and never looked back.I like a strong cup of coffee and this coffee pot certainly delivers on that aspect. It is so easy to use. I also just love the wide variety of coffee pods. I’m still exploring the different flavors. It’s a wonderful coffee machine and I’m very glad that I have one.I didn\\'t drink coffee 2 years ago, but while I was renting an apartment in Midwest area, my landlord had one of these and I got hooked instantly.\\n\\nI recently moved and the one the first things I had to buy was this. It is so easy to use and flavor of the coffee is always consistent and good. My personal favorite is a drink called \"Carajillo\" where you can mix a shot of espresso and liquor 43 with ice. This machine is a must in my countertop now.The machine showed up in a regular cardboard box laying on top of some taped together bubble wrap, with multiple scuffs. The swivel bracket for the water tank was disconnected but it did snap back into place. All of the pods were throw about in the box and multiple were opened. There was no Aeroccino Milk Frother which was included in my purchase. I bought it as a Christmas gift, thinking about testing it to see if it works before I gift it to my loved one.Like everything about it.The coffee is-to me- not good. I’ve tried all the variations of coffee in the welcome package. They all taste exactly the same- just variations of extremely bitter coffee. It’s way more bitter than any Starbucks coffee I’ve ever had.\\nWhat I didn’t pick up from the information is that you have to buy separate pods in order to get a bigger or smaller cup. I mistakenly thought the amount of coffee dispensed was a function of a setting on the machine.\\nThe machine is easy to use. Based on other reviews, I will bring the water to the tank and fill it versus removing the tank to fill. Hoping that way the chance of leaking is lessened.\\nHave only had it a week. Will update in a month.\\n\\n**edited** worst coffee I’ve ever made at home. Ended up giving away the coffee maker. Expensive lesson.1st of all this is the best thing especially with these times not being able to get out much. Or wanting to save some money.\\nIt is smooth and the taste is delicious the aroma lights up our small kichen . Great purchase we could have made .product arrived new condition and quickly but I had to take it to the Nespresso store to trouble shoot and they replaced it free of charge because it was broken. Nothing shipper could have done.No me agrado la cafetera me la mandaron usada y muy sucia por eso la devolví estaba en mal estadoWhat else is there to say? This makes delicious coffee and it does it very quickly. It even self-ejects the pod when finished. We love it!\\n\\nUPDATE: 6 weeks later and we still love it! We use this several time per day and it is awesome.Works great! I’ve had it for 2 months now and use if daily with no issues, no leaking or problems, however I do wish the coffee came out hotter, it doesn’t get hot enough it’s just “hot” so if you drink it right away it’s fine but if you take your time to gradually drink it, it’s not hot enough. Overall love my machine.IncredibleHello\\n\\nSo my Nespresso supposed to be used but it\\'s an open box one so it\\'s like new. I got it for about $100 and the regular price for the new one is about $180 so I save almost $80 and it came with the milk frother and a sample set of Nespresso pods. I\\'m a huge coffee drinker and with everything locked down and I\\'m really enjoying making my coffee at home.This makes a great cup of coffee and espresso. The temperature if perfect---hot. The creamy froth with each cup is perfection. It was easy to operate immediately on arrival. Other reviews had mentioned water leakage as a problem, but I have experienced none of this yet. I purchased the system for my office. It is a great midmorning and midafternoon indulgence. Now I wish I also had one for home use. I appreciate the used pods recycling option as one of my biggest concerns with this type of system was adding to the landfill. I prefer very robust coffee, and the IntensO coffee and the DiavolittO espresso are my favorites, but even the less robust samples have been very enjoyable. My husband prefers a decaffeinated coffee and reports the Decaffeinto IntensO espresso is excellent.My first Nespresso. Coffee tastes good. But I feel like the button isn’t very responsive sometimes. Like I have to press hard several times and wait for some seconds before it starts working. Weird!Amazingly good!!! It’s my Starbucks every morning but made in my own kitchen.\\nLove my Nespresso!Makes a great tasting latte! Better tasting and much more convenient than where I USED to go. And despite each pod costing a tad over $1, it is almost sad to say that that is 1/4 the price of going out to the coffee house. I use the frother whisk without the coiled wire attachment for the perfect amount of milk/froth.\\n\\nSo far, zero issues with leaking or any mechanical problem. I am very satisfied with this purchase. If you sign up on the Nespresso website, where you can order future pods, you can get some \"freebies\" on your first three orders. After my first 75 cups made, it should pay for itself!UPDATE....4 Months in using multiple times a day...We love it. So awesome.\\nFirst Review....Was recommended this from a friend. Got it and my wife says \"Best coffee she has ever had\". I am really impressed. If this unit holds up...this is a home run. The reason why I even say this...is this thing is so automated and cool........and my wife loves it...I pray it holds up. We are using it multiple times daily. Also...make sure you read up on Nespressos ratings of the coffee and what the numbers mean. They stand for Intensity and bitterness level. We tend to like the lower numbers. THe higher numbers were way to bitter for us.From the first cup to the current cup an amazing journey of taste and happiness I was so excited to get my first nespresso. I didn’t realize the capsules/pods weren’t ejecting out by itself. Sometimes I have to stop it halfway for it to catch up to the rods and then lift it all the way up. For the amount of money we spend it shouldn’t be this much work. And sometimes that doesn’t even work. I exchanged for another one and it happened again. People had said you can bend the rods but it’s brand new and I did not want to mess with that. Very disappointed so I got the order version instead.I was disappointed in the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and decided to return it. My daughter loves hers and wanted me to try it. I found it very difficult to adjust the cup size from espresso to a larger cup of coffee. There was too much crema and when the Nespresso ( just a lucky try) did make a larger cup of coffee, it was watery and tasteless. I thought this machine would be great for me because I can never make a good cup of coffee on my own. It turns out the Nespresso was no better than a cup I make myself.Easy to operateI love everythingBought this for my wife and her coffee addiction. I have since joined the dark side (pun intended) and am all about the Nespresso. Easy to use and very quick. It\\'s only making our coffee addiction worse but I can\\'t complain too much when it means we\\'ve stopped going out to buy coffee every day.Play Video\\n Very happy with everything. Looks great and tastes even better:)Absolutely love this machine and frothed. It’s easy to make my gourmet coffee at any time, especially since I’m working from home. It’s quick and easy to setup and use.There was no instruction manual, so I had to get a friend who already had a Nespresso to show me how to open the lid to put in a pod. We brewed four cups - each one continued brewing until 27oz had come out. We looked up the instructions online and our assumption is that it was stuck in descaling mode, but we were unable to reset the machine, despite following the online directions. Overall very disappointing. Sending it back.I love coffee! I have an expensive burr grinder, a top-of-the-line coffee brewer, coffee press, the works. I buy different beans and make my own blends. Just so it\\'s clear, I love coffee! So, I was somewhat reluctant to purchase a Nespresso when my wife said it\\'s sometimes easier to make just one cup instead of a whole pot when we no one will be home. \"That\\'s what they have Starbucks for.\" I argued. But when our frother finally died, I thought it would be a good time to buy the Nespresso Combo Machine plus frother.\\nWow! This thing actually makes great coffee! Hot, perfectly brewed coffee! Haven\\'t tried all the varieties yet, but Intenso and Stormio are great. And the frother works very well also. Life is good!Totally revolutionized my coffee life. Saving so much money by not getting Starbucks, plus the convenience of having it at home. Ultimately, the real icing on the cake is how easy they make it to recycle and how much less waste we\\'re creating. Definitely gonna be a Nespresso drinker for years to come!Whenever I go to the salon I am offered a coffee and I finally asked them why their coffee is so good. Low and behold they said it was a Nespresso coffee. After missing a good cup of coffee in between appointment, I finally broke down and replaced by Keurig with this machine. As I can\\'t get my cup to taste as good as the salon\\'s, I have concluded it must be because at the salon I am being pampered and am relaxing! :)Product came in a messed up/damaged box.. we ordered a new one and it was not new and has clearly been used and then returned and resent to us.We like to call it our morning with George Clooney! Love trying all the flavors! Sneak in an espresso in the afternoon and life seems more delightful!Machine appeared to work properly, but after sitting for a long weekend in my office, I came back to find my credenza water soaked and 1/2 of the water tank emptied. The tank itself is not leaking, rather water is coming out of the front of the bottom of the machine near the front. It appears to leak more the fuller the water tank. Credenza is now permanently damaged!I like this machine, it\\'s easy to use, comes with a milk frother, and has samples. Unfortunately, I can\\'t find the capsules anywhere but on the website. Many of the local stores sell the \"regular\" smaller capsules, but haven\\'t started the larger ones yet (that are required by this machine). That\\'s my only complaint.I wasn’t sure what to expect when I bought this, but I swear it has by far EXCEEDED every expectation there is in having an expression machine that produces phenomenal expression on demand; all from home! The froth machine I got for it to add milk to the expresso is the tree topper to an already amazing machine. I’d highly recommend this product to all my coffee lovers out there!Hace un año excelente café pero nunca he podido conectarlo a wifi busque todas las recomendaciones posibles y no se conecta.So, it got delivered (extremely late) with a huge hole in the box. Delivery guys need to calm down. Second, it made the coffee pods damaged and smashed in the process. Most were still usable. Also, I received a different color than I ordered. I should have gotten chrome and I received a blah light grey. I didn’t even realize it right away because I was so focused on making sure it wasn’t damaged and worked properly. Anyhow, so far it works fine and I’m really enjoying trying different flavors of the pods. Overall I’m glad I purchased it, it was just a little bit of a mess coming.I received this from Amazon warehouse deals so I bought it at a discounted price for open box and it is amazing. The coffee is definitely delicious and coffee house quality. The only downside is the cost of the pods. However it beats $4 a cup at the local coffee shop. Some of the flavors are just too strong for me. Those two reasons are why I gave it 4 stars. My husband loves the espressos. He thinks this is the best machine ever!Bought this to replace my previous Nespresso machine that lasted 10 years, and can\\'t say I\\'m impressed with this \"newer\" model. First off it\\'s all plastic and destined to break at some point, while my old machine was at least 70% made out of steel. But the immediate issue is how the ejected capsules constantly get stuck at the neck and fail to drop into the waste container. I have to constantly reach in and fish out capsules. It appears the neck design is simply to narrow to reliably pass the capsules.I like the machine. The coffee is very strong and the froth is great. Not a lot of flavors to choose from\\nBut here is what irritates me about this brand..you have to order their coffee thru them, they are expensive, they charge $7 for shipping and tge delivery is NOT reliable. I ordered a week earlier for a party I was having. Well a week later no coffee. No store has it. So if you dont have another machine for a plan B , you have no coffee. Thats what happened to me. My party is tomorrow and I cant offer coffee unless I go out and buy another machine...REALLY?!! How inconvienient! Like tge coffee is coming from Italy!! I Only recommend this machine if you have another brand handy. Machine is super cool and easy to use. The coffee flavors we’ve tried so far are amazing and the froth the machine creates on top adds a touch that makes the coffee seem smoother. The Aeroccino milk frother is something I thought of as a gimmick at first adds the fancy cafe/coffee shop topping that I didn’t know I was missing.\\n\\nHowever, upon first use, which is a cleaning cycle of water only, a very large puddle under the machine appeared.\\n\\nWhen making coffee this becomes even more apparent due to the brown color. I’ve contacted Nespresso through their store here in the hope of a remedy (really want to have a non-leaking machine). Otherwise I’ll have to reach out to Amazon for a refund.\\n\\nI will update this review with information regarding Nespresso’s customer service and “fix” or Amazon’s response if I need a refund after all is said and done.\\n\\n***UPDATE*** Contacted Nespresso by phone after no reply to email. Support person walked me through poking a paper clip in over flow hole and filler spout. Still leaked. They said since I had bought the machine through Amazon I must return through there. Easy enough through Amazon to send back. Ordered a Virtuo Next by Breville, not as cool of a machine but no leaks so far!I bought this machine from Amazon at a very good price (<$100). However, everything that was advertised was not included. Namely there was no welcome kit/coffee included. I called customer service and they didn\\'t want to do anything about it except sell me some coffee. So if you expect to get everything in the bullet items, don\\'t count on it. Buyer Beware. 🎈🎈Update: After this review, I was contacted to \"give \\'them (Amazon)\\' another chance.\" I did and they fully (and then some) compensated me for the missing coffee. Consequently, I am changing my rating to five stars.My only complaint is that it doesn’t get very hot. The flavor is great and the frother works wonderfully.The machine is very easy to use and clean. Everything is just one button. I only drink espresso with milk. So far no leaking (I did purchase an extended warranty after reading all other reviews).\\n\\nMy only complain / suggestion the curvature of the machine and the curvature of the cup are conflicting, making the dripping a little bit \"dangerous\". I am always afraid that it doesn\\'t drip into the cup.After trying Kuerig and other coffee machines, Nesspresso by far makes the best coffee. First and foremost, Nesspresso is a coffee company. They do not make teas and you cannot buy non-Nesspresso brands for their machine. They made the machine to ensure their coffee is brewed correctly. Each type of pod has a barcode underneath that tells the machine how how to brew each kind of bean. The coffee brews quickly and tastes delicious and has a crema finish. Both coffee and espresso pods are available. The pods are pricey but if you\\'re looking for quality over quantity, this line makes perfect sense. It\\'s still cheaper and tastes better than Starbucks!Ease-of-use.Update 11/20/20: I received my replacement from Amazon. So far so good. Coffee tastes great. The foam is something to get used to. I didn’t know the machine came with a sample pack of coffee so that was a nice surprise to try different varieties before committing to a specific roast.\\n—-\\nI was craving my first cup of nespresso coffee all day. I came home, went through the cleaning process, opened the lid back up and inserted a pod and now it won\\'t close. Called nespresso directly, was on hold for about 10 mins and the tech finally told me its probably defective and to return the machine. Big disappointment so far. Now I need to somehow return the machine but still need to figure out how to close the lid first!Love this product. The milk frother works well. Tip - use Oat milk - healthy and works better than soy, almond or coconut milk. Fill line in the frother is hard to see - just use the spinner to judge your milk level. (Note: the spinner is held in place with a magnet - you can remove it to clean.) Water dispenser is large and easy to fill. Unit quickly makes a great latte or cup of coffee....it senses which one you are using.It makes perfect coffee!! I never believed I could make a good cup of coffee at home!I ordered this machine for our camper because I’m completely addicted to my Nespresso Vertuo machine at home. This machine has a smaller water reservoir and the cup holder is a thick plastic instead of metal. Overall brews the same great coffee. If you aren’t caught up on looks or larger water capacity this is a great little machine.The box arrived damaged and it is clear that the product is not new as labeled, but instead used. Additionally, the package arrived way late.I bought this coffee maker for my husband for Christmas and he was so delighted. He doesn’t use our Keurig much at all anymore.Been through many brands of cup coffee makers. All so-so. This was clearly better in flavor, cremma. I bought for gift. Waiting for my K cup to break so I can buy one of these.This Nespresso has changed my life. I don’t usually drink “American Coffee” because I’m use to my coffee being made with espresso grinds like Cuban coffee but WOW. The flavors are great, the frother is fantastic and the machine is easy to setup and use. I wish the pods were a little more economical but for now my suggestion to anyone purchasing this machine, by the pods in BULK once you find the one(s) you love.I have wanted a Nespresso machine for ages, so when my Keurig died it was replaced with a moment Vertuo Plus. Thoroughly enjoy trying out the various Nespresso coffee podsIt pours less than 1/3 of a cup per serving. I have tried everything to have it pour a regular cup and nothing has worked.This Vertuo is a game changer. The old Nespresso machine (original one) with the little pods can’t begin to compare. I love Bianca legarro for espresso and Columbia for coffee. This is an easier machine and the coffee is deeper in flavor and better overallVery happy with this coffee maker and milk frother! Haven’t had any problems with either of them so far and been using consistently for about 2 months. I will say to make sure you use a large coffee mug when making coffee and adding frothed milk. I didn’t have a mug big enough so I had to get a “latte sized” mug. The mug platform on the coffee maker is pretty small so you have to hold your mug on it the entire time your coffee is brewing. All in all I’m very happy with this product!I am a casual coffee drinker, not a regular drinker. I like having an espresso while reading a book or watching a show on TV on a casual Friday evening. It doesn\\'t take a math genius to figure out that at about $1 per brew, this thing saves you tons of money over overpriced seattle coffee chains. While they sell their upscale brews for what? 4 or 5 bucks? you get better quality in each brew out of this machine for $1. That is golden arch price for better than seattle overpriced quality. Stop reading and go buy one of this machines.We started with the Essenza Mini. We loved the coffee from that so much that we needed more, so we purchased the this; what a great investment. Now we can enjoy larger cups of the coffee we love. No issues with the machine. Just pop in a pod and go. The froth is amazing. I\\'ve not used my frother yet because we don\\'t need it. No funcionó como esperaba y pensé en devolver, pero lo he mandado arreglar y hoy funciona y he decidido conservar ya que era solo un pequeño problema, gracias por ser pacientesOnly disjointed is the temperature of the coffee coming out. It\\'s not the hottest. The flavor of these Nespresso products is the best of any coffee I\\'ve tried. It really is delicious, better than Keurig and Starbucks no joke.While staying in a hotel, this was the only coffee option so I begrudgingly tried it...and realized what I’d been missing. Immediately ordered & have used it daily at home. Rich, creamy cap-drinks. Delicious, fast & convenient. I’m a huge fan of the quality & taste. The machine is quiet, well constructed & heats up fast. Love it!Every morning my wife tells me it is the best cup of coffee she has ever had. Easy to use, and customer service is top drawer. Sorry I waited so long to get it.I purchased for my wife as Xmas present. 2 days after Christmas the machine would not start to brew the pod but only puncture it. I called for help and was told how to reset the machine which is not in the instructions. After another 10 days the coffee pod would not eject into the back waste container. Lastly, several days ago the water pump keeps running until the entire water tank is empty like it in cleaning mode. 3 strikes and it is being returned tomorrow just under the return window. I will not buy this model again but will try another one that has a better track record. If you are purchasing this model, you may want to purchase an extended warranty. WE loved the look and how easy it was to use this model but with all the problems we to not feel safe exchanging for another one.It is really good machine especially if you like to have different cup sizes, but when it come to taste I felt that the original is still much better even in some cases of not using nespresso original podsI just had my first cup of coffee...omg it was delicious. I have an expensive espresso maker and a Keurig, I will not use them any more. The milk frother is super easy. My husband was not in favor of paying this much until he tasted his first cup. We are coffee snobs.Everything I wanted and needed. It’s no Starbucks but it will work. One of the coffees in the trail pack I was allergic to but I love the expresso pods. I like how it’s get frothy. It hasn’t leaked since I got it which has been two weeks and the used pods fall backwards in the the tower for disposal every time, no problems whatsoever other than I not sure how to do different cup sizes it sort of confusing to me. But like I said it will work😌It stopped working after 5 months. It wouldn\\'t power on and, when it finally did, nothing happened when you hit the button to brew. I contacted Nespresso via their online form and did not receive a reply. After a week, I called them. They hung up on me twice and the third time they offered to have ME take it to UPS once they mailed me a box, telling me I would likely be without it for another 3 weeks while it was worked on/shipped. When I asked if they had any plans to make up for a month without a coffee maker, she offered a $10 sleeve of coffee. Really?!?!?Best espresso machine I ever owned. I have always had an espresso machine since spending 9 years in Italy back in the 70s. The Nespresso VertuoPlus is great machine for the price. Although the coffee is a bit expensive.This has been a \"junk\" purchase from the start. It has been progressively worse with the time. First it would show red; restart and then it would work. Now it is red/yellow and can\\'t get it open; and NO coffee. and today it won\\'t even open to put coffee product in.l. Update. After contacting NESPRESSO they told me it was my fault. Amazon then made an exception and gave me a new one. Next day NESPRESSO representative called and said they were so sorry and that the machine was defective. They are sending me a small gift of coffee pods. Called Amazon to call the number I gave them and retrieve their money. 😹Best thing since slice bread! This machine made me a coffee drinker that’s how good the coffee it produces is.\\n\\nOnly Con would be that it was shipped all the way here to the UK in its original packaging no Amazon box!I have had my machine for nearly a year. The coffee it makes is very good. My machine has been \\'acting up\\' lately. It started flashing red on the power button. That means it needs to be cleaned. You can only purchase the cleaning kit from Nespresso. It is a bit of a tedious process to clean it. I have had to clean it multiple times. I always use filtered water. Lately, it has been making a clattering sound and stops working until I unplug and plug it back in. It is a bit of a pain. It has also been producing coffee with a bit of a burned taste.Great coffee machine. Easy to use, makes good coffee, and doesn\\'t get in the way in the kitchen.\\n\\nOnly issue is that the since the coffee has to be purchased in pods it is inaccessible for last minute purchase and also ends up more expensive than any other coffee machine where you could grind your own beans or buy ground coffee to brew. I suppose the cost is offset by the fact that the coffee is of good quality and is less expensive than chain coffee shops.We use it every day and everyone in my family loves it.This machine is amazing. The coffee is pricey. But to me it\\'s worth it. Your able to use your own favorite coffees. I highly recommend it.Love small footprint, speed and flavor. Capsules more expensive and lack flexibility in assortments.My espresso unit lasted just over 2 years, which is generous considering it wasnt heavily used. I ran a cleaning process every time the pod resevoir filled up. When it worked it worked great but I cant give anything other than 1 star to a product that dies before it even needs to be descaled. Nespresso says a descaling process should be done after 600 pods, i dont think mine made it to 250. I am very angry and disappointed and have no plans to buy another Nespresso product in the future.This makes my morning so much easier. Instead of throwing away half a pot of coffee, I make what I need. The strength of the coffee is great for a wake up.\\n\\nThe only downside is the price of the pods. If I quit using this, that will be why.I\\'m never going back to Keurig again! This coffee is so much better than Keurig and Starbucks. My parents liked it so much they bought their own machine.\\nUpdate: the machine started leaking in the back. We troubleshooted with Nespresso and it didn\\'t work. Had to send back to fix (under warranty) they are sending a loaner. Not happy that it broke down so soon.I really like so much this machine. It works smoothly and precisely how I wished it.Oh so lovely. The coffee is so good! Well worth the price.I like the water reservoir\\'s ability to swing to the left or right as needed for where the Nespresso is placed on the counter. Love the way used capsules are lifted up and out of the capsule holder and slide down into the capsule container at the rear of the Nespresso. When its full of used capsules the capsule container is easily lifted off the back of the Nespresso, the used capsules disposed of and the container returned to its place again on the back of the Nespresso. No fuss, no muss!This machine does make tasty coffee. For that it gets more than one star. But our machine broke within the first two months of light use (approx. 40 capsules in). Our machine started leaking coffee down the back of the machine, into the used capsule container, initially hiding but ultimately creating a mess following every use.\\n\\nTrying to get it fixed was, unfortunately, very challenging and still ongoing. Instead of making it fast and straightforward to provide a replacement, Nespresso has a Byzantine customer service process that requires calling in (long hold times, with no monitoring of email), and eventually led to Nespresso sending a box for shipping (1 week), agreeing to evaluate and attempt to repair it (4-6 weeks), and then either sending a repaired machine or replacement (additional 1 week). We are mid-process, and this is taking in excess of TWO MONTHS, during which, we are without the coffee machine.\\n\\nOur experience would be substantially better if the machine hadn\\'t been defective and, more importantly, if Nespresso had a more expeditious method of replacing defective products.I liked the ease of use and I didn\\'t order much for my parents and my parents had a good idea about the place to go there any time and we will be there for the weekend of our anniversary. But the cappuccino is to die for.I have a camper the size that\\'s very nice easy to clean works well with camperLiked this so much I bought another for our camper! Make sure you purchase the right pods for it. Many delicious flavors availableIt doesn\\'t come in a box which is NOT good for Christmas GiftThe machine is awesome but the flavors of the coffee pods are not! I order a reusable pod to see if I can drink from this coffee machine.I give it five stars because it makes an incredible cup of coffee my only complaint is the coffee isn’t hot enough for me. But I assume that could be my personal view. However I would recommend it.Really can’t go wrong. Durable and makes great coffee. Need to experiment with pods to see what works best.Was happy with machine ... coffee comes out hotter than previous machines ... however it started leaking coffee after 17 months of use . I had advised a friend to buy it too ... same thing happened with him ... machine started leaking after 6 months . A hassle to repair .\\n\\nDelonghi Nespresso vertuo plus . If you want machine to last longer , buy something elseI do love my nespresso! If u like the frothyness in your coffee then this is the machine for u. I havent had a need to use the milk frother yet. only downside is no retailers in Honolulu sell the pods so I have to order them on line. Also be sure to read the manual before using as it gives great tips like how to free flow pod to\\nyour desired amount.I have sent one of these to everyone. All I want in the morning is a PERFECT cup of coffee. Not a mediocre potful. I love the choice of pods. I love the “crema”. I love saying goodbye to Starbucks!!! This hasn’t saved me any money, though - seriously it makes the BEST gift but that runs up it’s cost!!Can’t live without this!!\\nThis is my second Nespresso machine.\\nMy husband used to spend $6~$8 for the cup of coffee everyday but not anymore. So easy and taste is soooooo good.\\nMy favorite is double espresso!!I had tried using the less expensive Nespresso Vertuo machine. It was junk, this machine is quiet, and works very well.The major description says graphite metal, thus giving you the impression that it is made from metal. It’s not. Rather it is a cheap looking gray plastic. It is not until you read the small letter description at the bottom that it says plastic on the final line. This is my second purchase of a Nespresso coffee maker. The first purchase is a much more better looking product. Look at the other Nespresso products sold on Amazon before purchasing this one. This is very cheap looking!!!!I’ve had a hard time learning to use this machine.\\nI had no idea more pods would be so expensive.\\nWhen I searched for reusable pods I found nothing that addressed this model.I bought this model because, unlike the \\'Original\\' Nespresso Machines, this new Vertuo models have capability of brewing regular \\'drip-style\\' coffee. However, I was soon disappointed. The coffee temperature is MUCH lower than the original machines. I believe this is a known, due to the type of brew process (not using pressure but centrifuge instead). In fact, if you read the user manual troubleshooting guide, under the \\'Coffee is not Hot Enough\\' section, it tells you to pre-heat water before putting it into the container. Im still suprised that I pay >$100 for a coffee machine, and still have to use my microwave to get HOT coffee. Also its impossible to buy Vertuo capsules in stores. And buying from Amazon, you can only buy a 30-pack quantity. My advice is to buy the Original model Nespresso machine, and get \\'coffee\\' pods, instead of pure espresso pods.Love this Nespresso, I was fortunate enough to get it at a discounted price and love it. It’s easy to use and does not take up a lot of space. The water chamber is easy to fill I could take it out and fill it or just take the lid off and fill it will it’s still connected to the machine. Would definitely recommend.This machine is super easy to use and makes the best coffee!! A friend had me try it a couple years ago but the machine was pricey. Got a great deal at Christmas... and the aeroccino is such a bonus! Well worth the investment for coffee at home! (Used to have a keurig, but that was terrible tasting so I gave it away.)Very good coffee machine, very recommended!!!Woks much easier and takes up 1/2 the room on my counter than my large Keurig. Push button operation.The best coffees I\\'ve had, there\\'s so many really great tasting coffee and espresso I get excited every time I try out a new one!Exactly as advertised! Everything works exactly as described, makes a fantastic cup of coffee, espresso or longo.\\nCoffe volumes are exactly as they should be with the various pods. I’ve actually measured and confirmed the ounces to a “t”.\\nCoffee temperature is spot on between 170-175 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nHave it about two weeks now and am extremely happy, as I love a good strong coffees etc.When I received this product it looked like it had been previously opened I confirmed that when I called Nespresso for instructions to use the machine since they were missing from the package. Nespresso confirmed that a sample package should have been included. It was then that I realized the machine was used because when I ran the first brew with just water to clean it, it seemed odd that coffee grains washed up on a new machine. I don\\'t typically write reviews however this is truly upsetting and requires attention. Amazon should not be sending out used merchandise and if they do, they should at least let the buyer know that its used allowing them to make the decision if they want that product.Delicious coffee and espresso.\\n\\nCheck if the Vertuo pods are available locally or order online with machine so you’re not stuck with just the samples for 2 weeks like I wasI was enjoying making my coffee drinks until it stopped working after I only had for a little over a month! The green light started spinning and the product was pushing out liquid amounts further than it did before. I wanted to give this a better rating because I did like the coffee selections, but I\\'ll have to another brand for now. Have returned this product.This is everything I wanted my Kuerig to be, and MORE. God I love using this thing. You want quality espresso? Check. You want a quality cup of coffee to jump start your day? Check. You wanna mimic that $10 cup of coffee you get at Starbucks, and THEN some? Check! Checks all around. Hell, they even give you recipes on their website so you can spice things up a bit! I can\\'t recommend this thing enough. Oh and the drinks come out so nice and fancy looking. I feel a little bit more and more like Clooney every time I brew a cup!We have been using Nepresso for 7-8 years started with an older unit but still in good shape, we couldn’t resist the price! It get be expensive with buying pods is the usual con re: nepresso, but I have not step into a Starbucks since first unit.... the consistency, convenient, efficiency is worth the pods expediture.... but then for me coffee must be unconditional, it is the one thing I depend on, and that is priceless if you can find that it meets your expectation every sipGreat machine! I feel fortunate to have such great coffee for about a dollar per cup.\\nSounds like a powerful motor & coffee comes out very hot.What an amazing coffee and froth machine. Bought this for my daughter and then I needed my own! Makes the absolute best cup of coffee and there are so many flavors.The capsules for the machine is little bit pricey.Love this system. Still trying to find which coffee we like the best. Since the coffee is basically whipped an 8oz cup will need a bigger cup.This makes a delicious cup of coffee, is easy to use, and doesn\\'t keep a large footprint in my small kitchen. Perfect for our small, caffeinated, coffee-obsessed family.I absolutely love this machine! I’ve wanted one for quite some time and I am thrilled. The coffee comes out so frothy and I love that! And the milk frother that came with it was a huge bonus. I feel so fancy. Love it!!!!! 10/10 recommend.Is it the machine, the coffee, both.. I do not know. What I do know is that this is the best coffee I\\'ve ever had in a home system.The espresso is not that hot to me just warm enough. If you like real hot espresso is not that hot, the rest is ok, for the price I think they can do better. I just did not wanted to buy a big machine and take the space in my counter and make allot of noise when you are steaming the milkWe bought our first Nespresso about 1 year ago, and really enjoyed the flavor of the coffee. The problem was our first one quit working and began leaking internally all over our counter about 2 months ago. Because it was maybe 1 year old, and my wife really loved the taste of the coffee, we decided to buy another one. Our new one worked for only a few weeks, maybe 1 month before it to quit working. For the price of these things, along with the ridiculous cost of the coffee, ABSOLUTELY not worth it. Don\\'t believe me, just check out some of the crazy Youtube videos about how these things quit working for other people, and the hilarious things people go through to try and get them to work. Save your money and just stick with your Keurig.I’ve had a Keurig, I’ve had coffee pots, I’ve used the Keurig/coffee pot duo, I’ve used espresso machines. Nothing has been so easy and taste so good. We love it.love it more than my original nespresso. brews a full, frothy cup!Received just the Nespresso and was missing the milk frother and sample pack.Awesome! Buy it! The frother is really perfect and makes your coffee that much extraHands down best coffee maker I have ever had. Easy to use, brews great and the coffee is amazing. Hands down best online purchase I\\'ve made and the price is great.I received my Nespresso in the mail today and set it up and used it immediately. I cleaned it like the website said I should before I brewed my first cup. I used the free sample capsules that it comes with. The first one I used was supposed to brew only 7.7 fl oz and I used a 14 oz cup. When it finished brewing the cup was overfilled and spilling everywhere. I didn\\'t add anything to the cup before adding the espresso so I know that it brewed double the amount that it should have. It doesn\\'t give me the option for choosing a brew size so I know I didn\\'t pick the wrong capacity. I tried it again with a capsule that was meant to brew 2.7 fl oz and it filled a third of the same cup so I am left to believe it is my machine that is working incorrectly. I am feeling really frustrated because I was excited to use this for the first time but I am extremely disappointed in the way that it brewed my coffee. The second cup I brewed was really good and the aeroccino worked excellent, I just wish it had brewed the amount it said it would.Very frustrated with purchase. About 50% of the time when making coffee the machine turns off mid-cycle. With the cost of the pods this problem is just outrageous. I also now have a machine that doesn\\'t work, and about $200 worth of pods that I can\\'t use in any other machine. 0 out of 5 if I could.Brews excellent coffee very quickly. Easy to use and doesn\\'t take up a lot of counter space. Only downside is the cost of the pods.So glad my Keurig died. I am never going back. Nespresso coffee is far superior to the burned taste I was getting from the Keurig, the coffee quality is way better and I love the crema that develops on top of the coffee. I even prefer this coffee over the swill they serve at Starbucks. This machine is great. It has a small footprint, is easy to operate, has an easy to remove bin for the used pods and is just simple to operate. Highly recommendWonderful customer support !!\\n\\nHad something missing from an order - sent a complaint, and was instantly greeted with a response & they took care of it! 5 starsThis is my first Nespresso purchase and enjoying very much. Easy to use and great flavored coffee. Coffee comes out like at professional cafes.Two months after purchase the machine stopped working with the “red circle of death”\\n\\nWould not recommend purchasing this product.I really enjoy this product. It has helped me cut back on my Starbucks habit and is much faster in the morning. The pods are a little hard to find but I went to a local Nespresso store and they were helpful and there is a wide range of product. They also gave me the recycling container. Sometimes I just use the milk foamer to make a chai tea latte. Glad I finally got this. Also bought the Deco pod shelf which looks great and keeps the counter tidy.Stopped working in a little over a month. Piece of trash now as doesn\\'t functionGreat tasting coffee. Easy to use. I got a good deal on the unit because the original box was scuffed up and the starter pack of coffee was missing.So glad I persisted to try to find this holiday bundle. It’s a great machine and for the price, an incredible value! It makes a hot frothy cup of coffee and a rich espresso. The only thing that I dislike about Nespresso in general in the lack of pod availability. They have to be ordered. Making sure you always have coffee and espresso does require a little planning due to having to order. The frother that comes with this machine works great! I love being able to make myself a latte!Really like this coffee maker. Makes a great cup of coffee or espresso. The only problem I have is the lack of competition for the coffee pods. Buying from Nespresso is very expensive.la mejor cafeteraI’ve used the machine nonstop since I’ve gotten it. I was addicted to stopping and getting my coffee in the a.m. on my way to work and since working at home, I was looking for a substitute and this definitely is it.It took me a bit to figure out what coffee I liked from nespresso. They are stronger than what I usually drink. Once I got the hang of the machine and what coffee pods I liked it was fine but I found the directions very vague and the coffee description extremely vague for flavors and such.. it really is trial and error till you find the taste you likeSo this is my second Nespresso Machine. I have the Vertuo Bundle at the house and this one at the office. I like how simple the design is, I like how the cups are ejected into the back, I like the swivel water reservoir. I also, was surprised that the the top is motorized...when you go to put the capsule in you click up and the motorized top opens...you put in the capsule and click down once and it closes automatically...impressive...great quality...After a couple of weeks I noticed water pooling under the machine. The coffee is subpar and overpriced. Regret purchasing and not returning.I owned to Bosch tassimos, but after changing my location last time decided to go with something new. Both coffee machine and capsules are questionable. First one I ordered full automatic was broken, and after reading a lot of similar problems decided to order manual cappuccinatore(not working well at all, I have used a better ones). I cant say coffee is bad but hardware+capsules overall experience is not grate. I\\'m just writing this for people who already owned Tassimo before like me to do not even try. In terms of reliability will see but already feels half broken)The brew button is unresponsive after four months. I\\'ve sent it back twice and it still doesn\\'t work. They are trying, but I can\\'t give a review to something that seems like a lemon.\\n\\nWhen it works, the coffee is great. That\\'s what stinks about writing a negative review.This is my second Nespresso machine and I love it. It’s quiet, easy to use, and doesn’t take up a lot of counter space. The milk frother is perfect! I actually stopped going to Starbucks because I like my Mocha Cappuccinos better than theirs! I use organic milk, Truvia and of course Nespresso espresso pods. This machine was on sale before Christmas and I couldn’t resist. My 5 year old Nespresso machine is in our pantry in the event we may need it. Great deal!When our old coffee pot died I decided to upgrade. Best decision ever. It very to use and coffee options are huge.This is the most amazing coffee machine I have even seen. It makes the best coffee EVER! I would never pay this much money for a “coffee machine” but this is SO MUCH MORE. The coffee machine produces an amazing frothy brew, and the milk frother turns every cup into a treat. This is the best money I have spent in years!!!Super glad I purchased this item. The only downside at the moment is only being able to use Nespresso brand coffee pods which I wish I would have known prior to purchase.I love everything about it. It’s very easy to use and makes terrific lattes.Coffee is delicious. I stopped buying coffee by the cup. I even look forward to getting up in the morning just for the coffee!!We love this coffee maker! My husband was skeptical when our Nespresso first arrived. It took him less than a week to tell me to get rid of the Keruig. I used to say I wasn’t a coffee drinker, I added coffee to my cream and sweetener. I can drink Nespresso black, it’s that good. The frother makes great foam if that’s your thing. I bought another machine to give to my Starbucks loving DIL for Christmas. She too, is hooked on Nespresso nowMachine is overkill for espresso, BUT, and this is a huge BUT, if you want a terrific 8 oz or 15 oz cup of unparalleled coffee, this machine is way above terrific. And other reviews aside, the pods can be resealed using your coffee and “MY” brand foils!!!Really like this machine, but after about 6 months it stopped making hot coffee. I\\'ve tried all the tricks– heating the cup first, running it without a pod, but nothing works– all I get is a good flavored but lukewarm cup of coffee. And that\\'s immediately after it\\'s made and without putting anything in it! Add a drop of milk or let it sit for 1 minute and it\\'s below room temperature. Very disappointing, as it means the coffee is practically undrinkable.I wanted to kick my Starbucks habit but still enjoy the same quality coffee/espresso. I have to say, this machine completely exceeded my expectations. The crema on top is to die for! I was also impressed with the sample box as there was a wide array of different brews. If you\\'re on the fence because you\\'re a coffee snob like me go for it! It does not disappoint.I purchased this to replace my Keurig. Now let me just say that I am VERY tech savvy. I can literally take a computer apart and put it back together with no instructions and no problems. This machine does NOT give instructions on how to use. It literally only gives instructions on how to clean it upon arrival. My coffee is always too strong no matter what I do to it. I don’t like super sweet coffee but I don’t want bitter coffee either. A nice balance would be great. Also I was charged for a milk frother that I never received.Easy to useWorks great but pods are a little pricey. But $1 a cup is way less than $5 a cup from you know who.I already own this appliance. Makes a GREAT cup of coffee or espresso, and is simple to use. The pods are a little expensive,but with frothy milk,its a treat!I was pleasantly surprised by how easy this coffee system was to use and how good the coffee actually is. I have been forever spoiled!Bought in July and it has started leaking. Love the coffee but this machine is made very poorly. Looked on YouTube and past reviews and seems to be a common problem. I am going to try and get ahold of the manufacture because it should have a 2 year warranty. I will update this post after while.Love this machine. Great coffee. Ordering from Nespresso customer service is awesome...best customer service ever!When I first tried Nespresso coffee I was interested but hesitant because of the fact that coffee pods for competing brands are not recyclable. When I learned that I could, indeed, recycle the pods for this system, I felt like I could indulge in this wonderful coffee. I\\'ve not had the machine long so still have much to learn about which of the wide variety of coffees I like best. However, I\\'m enjoying it immensely so far. Just to emphasize, the recycling was the clincher for me.This is actually a good news story. The VirtuoPlus was defective - brew button broke within 90 days on a morning when I needed coffee! Called Amazon - the transferred me to Nespresso and although it took some time, was able to shift to a regular Virtuo as a replacement and Nespresso had it on my doorstep the next day. Kudos to Nespresso and love the new machine - although its less fancy, it’s built to work and makes you feel more like a barista as it has the twist and lock mechanism! Much happier now as this was a success story in my book.Great tasting coffee if you can get beyond the amount of crema (foam) it generates. Some suggest the crema enhances the flavor, I don\\'t. I have gotten around this excess crema by refilling the empty cartridges with my choice of ground coffee and reprogramming the brew process to a shorter cycle. Now it\\'s excellent.I love my Nespresso. It works like a charm & looks so cute sitting on my countertop. I love how smooth, creamy & delicious the coffee is. And I really love the fact that it brews the perfect cup every time by reading the barcodes - so cool! I would highly recommend this machine to anyone wanting a high quality machine!I literally cant stop using my nespresso machine. I use mine mainly for ice coffees and I\\'m obsessed!! MUST BUY!!!I have had this machine for a little over a month and it has already quit working…after a month (go figure) so I can’t even return it. Literally nothing has worked. I wouldn’t even waist money on this one.We bought this one to replace the same model where the filter was due for cleaning but the cleaning processes did not work. This one has been working well for the months since our purchase.The machine arrived as described. Only issue is the Nespresso box arrived without an outer box to conceal its content so the Nespresso box was damaged but not its content.muy buedn articulo me acrado mucgho lo recomiendoBeen using this machine for a couple of months now. Everything was as expected, really good machine, but the only problem I found is that the coffee does not come out very hot. I\\'m going to try using warm water in the water container and using a warm coffee mug and see if it makes any difference. This would be the perfect machine if the heating element made the coffee hotter.I will never go back to a Keurig or traditional pot of coffee!!! It’s so easy to use and quick! I’m always running late and it doesn’t hold me up any longer. I normally drink my coffee with some cream & sugar, but it’s very pleasant “AS IS!”Nothing really to dislike about this machine. It works as promised. Get a good milk frothing machine and your ready for a delicious cappuccino.Perfect in every way! This is literally the best coffee I’ve ever had. I love that you don’t have to waste a whole pot of coffee; it just makes one perfect cup at a time! It brews quickly so I don’t have to be late to work. 11/10 would recommendExcelenteRandomly turns on and begins brewing.\\nIt also will not stay off. You must unplug it to be sure it will not misbehave. It makes me pine for the Verismo machine it replaced.\\nI recommend everyone avoid this glitchy, overpriced, disaster.I originally got the Vertuo Evoluo because I was a recreational coffee/espresso drinker and didn\\'t think I needed the Aeroccino bundle. Ended up returning it within a week because although the coffee was good, it just wasn\\'t brewing hot enough. This machine is exactly what I was looking for - brews hot enough!!!, beautiful design, takes up less counter space, and comes with the milk frother. Worth the $$ in my opinion. Will update if I find that it leaks.Love my nespresso. It\\'s quick and quiet and makes delicious coffee/espressoI upgraded from the original. Still getting used to the new coffee sizes and blends but the machine is very nice and works perfectly.I used to have an original line Nespresso machine. They both doing very well, but the most attractive feature for VertuoPlus is that the capsule can make larger size coffee with the same quality.Best purchase I’ve made in a while. It’s easy to use and the flavors are amazing!AMAZING! BRAND NEW, FAST DELIVERY! THANK YOUGreat cappuccino every time works wonderfulI really love this machine. The lattes are so good. Easy on my stomach. I only use this now. Love all the flavorsUpdate 9 months later. Now the frother isn’t working properly. It won’t heat the milk any longer and sometimes is difficult to start. I’ll press the button and it will blink and never start. Seriously 9 months??? I am the only one that uses it once per day and I follow all instructions to a “t” for cleaning. I’ll reach out to see if I can get help with this but I really expect it to last longer than 9 months....\\n\\nWow, Starbucks coffee is a thing of the past now for me! As many have mentioned, the pods are the “worst” part of this system only because they are so expensive. But damn they are good. My drink at Starbucks was always soy latte. I have now perfected my homemade soy latte. I use the purple espresso pod and run it through 2 times. Then I use original Silk soy milk in the frother. Add the milk to the double espresso and voila! Best soy latte I’ve ever had for just over $1 per day. Not cheap but better than $4.50 at Starbucks. I’m happy!Amazing to enjoyThe only criticism is that occasionally it won’t process a capsule and if you open the lid it dumps the capsule and they are pricey.I had this machine for 9 months and I loved it but it started leaking coffee while brewing few days ago, I cleaned it and tried again and still leaks while brewing. I googled and seems like the vertuo plus machines all have this problem so now I\\'m not sure what I should do? buy another machine or switch to the nespresso original line ...I don’t ever want to live a life that doesn’t have a Nespresso machine.Love it!!! Seller is amazing! I was Missing one piece, he shipped it out ASAP! .My bad review is strictly for the water tank . I just opened it and remove plastic and then decided to clean it with water and soap and when I realized the complete water tank was scratched. It didn’t warn that it was not supposed to be clean with sponge . So now it is completed scratched . I’m very disappointed. Best purchase i ever made ! I love my nespresso machine so much ! You will not be disappointed. Also the vertuo pods are not that expensive and you get an amazing experience every morning 😊wish I could also brew some plain water for hot tea, but the unit makes up for that in a quality cup of coffee. Froth on top, are you kidding? I still add a bit of vanilla coffee mate for a little added flavor. Well made and sturdy I\\'m sure it will last, been two months so far. Took me a while to figure out the brew cycle, even with instructions, could be me..Excelente inversión, estoy muy contento…This Nespresso machine makes my wife a happy person. Not that she wasn’t before, but she is just nicer all day now. Before she would get crabby mid day and now she makes a cup of coffee and she’s tolerable again. This machine makes magic 8oz at a time.Love the machine BUT from the packaging it appeared that it was returned and then sold to me. All of the sample coffee pods were in a plastic bag knotted shut and the box that the coffeemaker came in was pretty worn.This is a very nice machine; the motorized compartment where the coffee pod goes is a fancy touch. The problem was the coffee. I did not like the coffee and my wife only liked two pods. Also, the temperature of the coffee was not very hot; it\\'s ready to drink right out of the machine, but by the end of the cup, or if you wait a minute to drink it, the coffee is cold. The milk frother doesn\\'t do well with soy milk, nor does it heat the milk enough either. I did not have problems with the water tank leaking as others have.\\nI would recommend going to a Nespresso store a few times and trying the coffee for free, prior to committing to buying the machine.Couldn’t be happier with this machine! Love this smooth and coffee-shop like my coffee and espresso’s come out!We have had one of these machines in the past and this one is even better with the larger water reserve. Makes a great cup of coffee.My husband loves it. Great taste of coffee. A treat for sure when we can\\'t go anywhere now.If you have been thinking about Nespresso, this is the machine to pull the trigger on! Every cup is perfect, and every flavor option I have tried is fantastic! Don’t miss out on the Cafe de Cuba...probably one of the best tasting cups of coffee I have ever had!Al principio muy buena después ya no funciono masEasy to useBest coffee you can make at home. Had a keurig and there is no comparison. So happy with this machineI love everything about the nespresso machineBottom line:\\n1) Nespresso coffee is delicious. Lots of styles to suit lots of different tastes.\\n2) Coffee from this machine is ALWAYS too lukewarm. It always goes in the microwave after it is brewed.\\n3) The milk frother included in this is a joke. Get a different unit. Milk is as lukewarm as the coffee and the whol frother broke in 8 months after minimal use.\\n4) Nespresso customer service is also a joke- totally uninterested in helping resolve any problems. Just bought a different frother.We love the coffee maker, we had been using a Kuerig forever and this is like getting a coffee from a coffee shop every day!Super easy to use! I’ve been looking at this for a long time and am so glad I made the choice to purchase.This is a GREAT machine. I am so satisfied. This one brews really quick and coffee is really hot. It takes up little space and allows to place anywhere since water tank can be moved.I had to unfortunately return it for few reasons 1) aeroccino wasn’t working. 2) the serving programming wasn’t working well. 3) it takes more space on the counter compared to my previous machine. I am fan of Nespresso and would be looking for another modelI love the frothing and the taste and quality of the coffee! So happy with my purchase!Makes much better coffee than the older Nespresso machines. If it wasn’t so expensive for the capsules I ‘d throw out my fully-automatic Gaggia but I drink a *lot* of coffee and need to trade offI love this machine!!! Skipping Starbucks most of the time now. Makes great lattes, just as good as Starbucks. Be sure to buy quality SYRUPs. The lavender syrupy is costly but a wonderful indulgence. I bought my machine used and refurbished (which significantly decreased the coffee) and so far so good. The only thing I dislike is the cost of the coffee pods. Hopefully the price will decrease as length on market increases.Exactly what we hoped for.The machine is awesome and brews wonderfully fancy coffee. Amazon, however, slapped a shipping label on the manufacturers box and shipped it. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my husband, but he came home to it sitting outside our house with what was clearly inside.Love it and treated myself as a Black Friday deal. Top quality factory delivery & equipment. I love the one we use for clients at work, this is the best of both worlds if you want both coffee & expresso. The prior model will only make you a cappucino, americano, or expresso. Two thumbs up for the milk frother I additionally use for my matcha lattes separate from the process.This machine makes good coffee, but once done the bottom of the Nespresso machine leaks water (1-2 cups) all over the counter over the course of the day. Not from the water tank, but the bottom of the machine. I attempted to get support through Amazon’s link, but got no response. I bought this machine new from Amazon just three months ago, and it started leaking after 2.5 months. Extremely disappointed and would NOT recommend.My coffee maker locks up about 3 times per week.🤨I have to unplug it and let it sit for a bit. I have called Nespresso and they walked be through a couple of things. And it still locks up. I must have gotten a lemon machine.I’m not happy having to wait for my coffee in the morning. And it makes strange noises. My sister has one and it is great. This is why I purchased this machine. Lon a happy morning for me.Play Video\\n It began to leak coffee at the bottom after I used it for 2 months. I had to call the customer service, I was asked to do all kinds of checks that took about 30 minutes on the phone before they agreed to have it repaired. I waited 2 weeks to receive the return kit, sent them the machine, and waited for another 2 weeks to get it back.This is the best easiest strong cup of coffee maker- I am happier than I thought I would be with it. Feels a little pricey when buying pods from Nespresso sight but only because it’s in a larger quantity- I’m saving so much money and the coffee is ridiculously good strong rich coffee/espresso. I am an ice coffeee drinker so I throw in a cube, some vanilla and it’s better than any shop on the corner.So much better than a Keurig! Tastes a lot better. The only issue is that it\\'s hard to get the pods other directly from Nespresso. They offer a lot of options though!I was a Kuerig user for many years. Always happy with them. A friend raved about Nespresso and I ordered it. Have had it for a year and every time I have my coffee I say out loud that’s a fabulous cup of coffee. I love coffee and this is just fantastic. More expensive pods but worth it. Get a milk frother with it for specialty drinks. The bestHave used for over a year and still my favorite coffee. Makes it tough getting coffee any other way.Lo mejor que e compradoBought this for my boyfriend at Christmas and he absolutely loves it! He’s thrown his Keirug away and says this is one of the best gifts he’s ever received. The coffee tastes rich and barista quality, it’s very attractive on your counter, super easy to use, and saves money on having to go to Starbucks or other coffe shops to get that quality and kick from coffee usually only made in those shops.The machine is a bit louder than my keurig, but it packs a punch. Frothy, strong, hot, favorable espresso.Exquisito lo mejor del mundo mi café mañanero, espectacular y se hace en unos segundos ,lo mejor que se a inventadoHighly recommend that you look at other options when buying. I got this machine for only $65.00 simply because the box it came in was damaged. Nothing was wrong with the machine. I’m glad I took a chance with this type of purchase. I saved a ton of money.Absolutely love this product ! Like I can’t even ! I look forward to mornings because of it ! Save so much money not going to Starbucks ! Easy to use ! Affordable ! Coffee tastes great ! I feel like a professional barista with it ! Love love love it ! No regrets whatsoever !!!!!!!Like the ease of use. Not crazy about the price tag on the pods, so I make my own now.Great tasting coffee every time, tastes almost as good as my espresso machine, but it takes a small fraction of the time to prepare a cup with the Nespresso VertuoPlus which makes it a great device for busy mornings. This honestly tastes better than most $2 or $3 dollar coffees or americanos that you would buy at any other store. The keurig should not be in the same conversation as this machine, there is a massive difference in taste, keurig tastes almost like instant coffee most of the time.This espresso machine was shipped to me in the Nespresso box only. It wasn’t put in a shipping box. So box is destroyed! Also, there is no owners manual in box! Very unsatisfiedI already have this great machine and decided to get one for my mom. At first she wasn\\'t sure but after a few days she put away the Keurig and is enjoying great coffee every day. I\\'m a big fan of Nespresso and now she is too. This is a great machine and is easy to use. It’s the best machine forever\\nI love it 😻In Love with this gadget! I love it and was enjoying since I got it. The price is perfect. Highly recommend.Normally I never write a review, but For this model ENV155 BAE by De\\'longhi espresso machine is good for 3 mos, I bought in December, 2019 and in March 2020 is start leaking water all over the counter, like other review it\\'s this machine is good for couple months and start having problem and leaking water. Be warethe milk frother broke in less than a monthI received 2 machines, at a good price on black Friday sale. Sent one back. The second one did not work! I read the manual which referred me to a specific # for solid red light. No go, called the club #, talked to a very nice agent who really tried to help it still did not work, so I was required to send it to them, because Amazon would put it back in inventory without fixing it. Company has quick turn around, so they fixed it, sent it back & it works. Unfortunately, I find the coffee very distasteful. So I will continue to use my Aeropress & battery frother. Their frother was excellent.Loved the coffee for 2 months. Quit working and Nespresso told me it would be up to 4 weeks for repair after they ship me a box to return in (that\\'s a long time with out a coffee maker for 4 people in our house that drink coffee). Coffee and Espresso were good - nice and frothy, but the machine was confusing to use if you wanted to change the regular programming or clean it or reset it. Button seems like it started sticking after 1 month.coffee maker leaks - returning itemLove my Nepresso. This machine has a large water tank and is very quiet.My wife and I love our new nepresso. Don’t have to go to Starbucks anymore 😎We are super disappointed in this machine. We have had other nespresso machines out last this one by far! Not worth the moneyThe product is nice, looks okay, great coffee and easy to use, but the capsules get sick in it all the time. They are supposed to slide out the back into a holder, but they get stuck when the holder gets full and when it\\'s empty. When it does work right, you can\\'t tell it\\'s full, so they get stuck. You\\'ll have to reach your hand into it to clear it, but then the thing that punctures the capsules press your and gets. I\\'ve stuck with it a long time, but I just name take it anymore. Looking for a replacement. But, besides what some other powwow said, it didn\\'t break for me, just that design flaw.Makes a great cup of coffee! Love the sample flavors. I am just one person, so this is more efficient and cost effective than any other option. wouldnt recommend this for a family or someone who drinks a lot of coffee because it can get a bit expensive.Great cup of coffee first time using . . . very happy!I liked the pods, come in handy if you only want to make one cupLove the flavor of the variety of coffees and feel like I am in Europe.I am in LOVE with this machine. Super fast to heat up and brew. The espresso taste amazing.I love this coffee maker! The coffee is rich & foamy, plus machine is quick and pretty quiet.\\nThe only thing I don’t really care for is the gray color, it’s a flat gray that looks more like a primer. I wish I had gotten black or red. Besides that it’s a great machine! No issues, no leaks, no problems.Nespresso surpasses my expectations. I can make a mean Americano with the excellent Nespresso espresso and my own pour over.Got a great deal on this! This makes the best coffee EVER, this coffee machine easily replaces my stops at my local coffee stands! I have suggested this coffee machine to all my friends (and some strangers!) the only “down side” is that it does get a little pricey but in the long run still much cheaper than a Starbucks!This unit rocks. Great coffee. Easy to use. Recommend strongly, especially if you are a true cappuccino person.we love the machine easy to use. It does not take up much room. Its attractive. Most important it makes a great cup of coffee.It\\'s been absolutely great! No leaking issues whatsoever.When using the Aeroccino Milk Frother by De\\'Longh, I find that the milk is hot but very runny. I like lots of foam. If someone could text me on how to improve my technique, my cell is 702-300-4150. I\\'d like to keep the Aeroccino Milk Frother by De\\'Longh.\\nThis model of Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee Maker was a big disappointment. I have 2 other models that have been more satisfying. I\\'d like to return this one for a full refund as I find myself using the other two that I have and ignoring this latest purchase. Please let me know how to return it.\\nThanks for any help you can give me. Judy HallgrenMy life now has some happiness in it. Thank you Nespresso.Easy set up, watch YouTube video much easier than reading directions, took 10 mins and was up and running. Love the machine, wish they had more variety espresso options. Overall good quality machine and easy to use and clean up. Def worth the purchase, lattes are excellent, and very nice look and feel to machine, my 10 year can make my latte, and loves it for her hot chocolatesWorked for a dozen or so cups, then stopped functioning. Called the Nespresso number, they sent pre-paid packaging for my malfunctioning unit, and I received the repaired unit today. No complaints - I was surprised at how quickly my issue was resolved. They also offered to send a loaner, which I didn\\'t really need.Best coffee ever. So much better than Starbucks and saved me a lot of money tooAbsolutely amazing machine.\\nReading some reviews, I was afraid that it could be too loud. It \\'s not, and coffee is delicious.\\nMilk frother is great, I can finally have lattes at home.\\n\\nI just wish that Nespresso pods are available in supermarkets.The coffee this machine produces can not be better. Any other machine will never produce what this does. Taste and aroma like in the best coffee shop. The only bad thing is that capsules are expensive compared with the Nespresso Original line and K-cups. But if you are a person who enjoys the flavor, aroma and body of a good coffee then this worth the value.Stopped working after a month, not sure why but i have called customer support and the only option is to pay repair cost that is nearly as much as machine or take a 35% discount on new model. We used this thing for a month but were unable to get a hold of support and eventually gave up. I got it for my wife\\'s birthday gift last year. When I talked to them today they walked me through the reset options which I had already found online and then said I had a faulty button and need to order a new machine. Not impressed as i have 40 pods I can no longer use after using this only 20 times.I had no idea about Nepresso until my millennial daughter introduced me.. keurig has been my go to.. I was totally against it because it was way more expensive. As are the pods... When I received it, not easy to use and after five days it stopped working and we had to return it.. pods are not interchangeable unlike keurig.. however it does make a good cup of joe... if ur like me and just need one cup a day of good coffee with ease, sorry but Nepresso is not it, try a keurig, I’ll get my replacement tmrw.. huge thanks to kohl’s and amazon for easy returnsThis machine is true elegance. Not only good coffee, but beautiful to look at. Also, having recyclable pods appeals to my concern for the environment.I love this coffeemaker! I don’t care for espresso so I use it strictly for coffee. I had a Keurig but had to replace it, and the new Keurig is terrible. So that’s how I got the Nespresso. I love the wide variety of pods that came with it too. The only negative is that I can’t use the k-cups I had with the Keurig, and boy, do I have a lot of them.Followed manual instructions, watched YouTube official videos, yet either way it doesn\\'t work. They say to plug, press the button and a green light is supposed to show up. The only light I saw was a blinking orange one. No matter what you do, it keeps doing that.I love this coffee machine but we had to send a request to replace ours within 2 weeks of owning it. The machine would make one or two cups of coffee and then get stuck in the “up” position. We have to unplug it for 30 minutes or more to get it to work again. I absolutely love the coffee it makes though!I am a coffee freak and this machine is awesome! I’ve had Kreurig’s and recently bought this for expresso’s and it beats all around for an excellent cup of java. I can’t go back to my old Kreurig maker now. No comparison.product is exactly as described by seller\\nproduct arrived 2 days ahead of etaReplaced my keurig. AmazingLove my new Nespresso machine! Only reason I’m giving this review 4 stars is because my machine was missing the 12 capsule coffee starter pack :( I was looking forward to trying out the different brews. Other than that, great machine and great coffee (purchased Stormio, Odacio, Melozio, and Altissio espresso here from Amazon)I was happy with this product until 1 month after my return policy expired, it began to leak. So now every time I use it, it leaks from the bottom. I think that even though it says you can move the water tank to be either in the back or at the side, that\\'s not true. It seems that it may have started leaking after I moved my machine and moved the water tank to be more to one side.Makes.delicious coffee and espressos. Life changing. So quick and easy. Love everything about it.Fantastic product. Use it everyday with zero complaints.I love everything about this machine except for the fact that it does not alert you when the water reservoir is low or empty. I have it under the counter and usually it is not well lighted, and I have had a few half or quarter filled cups. It should flash or not let you make a cup!!Well made. First one purchased was defective. Thanks Amazon for easy return/replace. Watch out for air bubble when you first set up. Lot of info on web. Once it’s fired up it’s great. Great coffee. Paired with Citiz+Milk.My kids bought this for me, Took me 2 minutes to learn...lol...I love itThis coffee maker makes the best, creamiest coffee. I don\\'t know how I lived so long without it. The technology of the machine is simple, quick, and efficient. There are lots of little convenience features that add to the enjoyment of this product, but bottom line...the coffee is fantastic!So far so good.\\nLooks very nice and is of high quality.\\nMade several cups of coffee and some shots of espresso with it soon as i got it opened and cleaned.\\nWell have used for over a week now and sadly the tank does leak a little if left on.\\nThe coffee is so good that i\\'m not going to reduce my review because of it.\\nIs fine if you just pop tank off when done.I just love this Nespresso coffee machine it makes a nice Creamy frofff on top the coffees are excellent you have to buy them separate they are a little bit more expensive for the pods But they are excellent each coffee is exquisite and each one has a distinct flavor everything from regular coffees to espressos they have it allLove itObsessed with this coffee maker and all the delicious options available. I was over spending in Starbucks coffees, so I decided we needed to cut back and save. I haven’t looked back and I love it.Nespresso is awesomeI liked it very much, the coffee was delicious. But it had a very short life, started leaking despite scaling, and even though it\\'s still under warranty I ordered a new one today, don\\'t think it\\'ll work after repairs.\\nI really hope that the new one will last longer.This machine makes really good coffee. I enjoy making lattes too!Makes delicious coffee drinks quickly. We love it very much. Great buy!Very pleased. Easy to use..easy to clean. Makes great cup of coffee.We used to have a Kerig and that was ok but the Nespresso is so much better quality and taste. I use my nespresso every day. The flavor is amazing and consistent. Even my hubby who doesn\\'t really like coffee drinks nespresso.Makes a great cup of coffee. Fantastic. Extremely easy to use.A bit pricey (the pods) but worth it, great cup of coffeeGreat product!! Is compact, quiet, amazing coffee... no more expensive Starbucks for me.I bought this refurbished for my office. Works great.Great product, but shipped in original display box, NO SURPRISE THIS CHRISTMAS!Love mine so much I bought this a mothers day gift. Far superior to a Keurig. Bold coffee flavor.My brother and his wife had this at their home and urged me to try it. BAM, I\\'m hooked, I\\'m done, there\\'s no comparison, THIS COFFEE MAKER IS LIFE! Ok, well it blows the pants off my Keurig. And the little foamer, what a treat. BUY IT!Purchased the Nespresso Machine Only and was super excited to get this and start using. I opened the Amazon box it was in to discover the actual packaging looked like it had been man handled by a toddler with jelly covered hands. The box had a sticker that said it was new, but you could see it wasn\\'t. The plastic handle that is on the top was missing, the cardboard tabs that are used to tuck in and close box were missing. It looked as if someone opened the box, used it, didn\\'t like it, and threw it back in the box. So I figure let me see if the unit looks used. Some of the machine looked unused, but when I plugged it in and opened the top to see where the pod is kept there were coffee grains in the pod holder. My guess is someone bought and returned saying it was unopened. I\\'m pissed because now I need to go out of my way to get it to a UPS store, but I had to order a new one and have to wait longer to get it.The coffee is great - this is my third machine. I purchased this one for my office, but the pods don\\'t eject like they\\'re supposed to. So far I haven\\'t been able to get much help in getting it resolved.I love this machine. It\\'s very easy to use, doesn\\'t take up a lot of space on the counter, and it work very efficiently. The espresso and coffee is delicious. It has completely replaced my old drip coffee and Keurig machines for good! I always wanted an espresso maker, but didn\\'t want the mess. Now I can have it without the mess. I love the pods! I don\\'t like frothed milk so this is the version without the milk steamer/frother.So easy to use and the coffee tastes great! I love it!I have no other kitchen gadget that gives me this much joy. I’m not sold on the coffees but the espresso and milk frother thing are ridiculous. The purple pod espresso is my favorite and better than any espresso I’ve had at a coffee shop. I’ve told my friends that much like indoor plumbing and air conditioning became the threshold for habitability in the 20th century, the Nespresso is that for the 21st century.I ignored the bad reviews and bought it anyway. First machine broke after 3 uses dispensed way too much water coffee was more like tea. And the replacement they sent didn’t dispense any water at all. Waiting for the 3rd machine because I’ve already invested $50 on the pods. Save your money it’s garbageI had this espresso machine for two weeks, and it leaked badly underneath. Sadly I had to return it and ordered a different style.Easy to use. Makes wonderful coffee. The pods that came with my machine offer a variety of flavors and strength. Love it.Liked the coffee flavor. Didn\\'t like that descriptions of different makers was minimal.I needed espresso so I replaced my Keurig with this almost 2 months ago and so far it’s been great. This helped me cut down on my almost weekly $40 spend at StarbucksThis machine works perfectly for a few months or even longer, then all sort of problems start happening. This is not my first experience with nespresso machines, I have been a very loyal customer since 2015, with more than 200 sleeves per year! … I replaced over 5 machines since then! Yes 5 machines! This is not what to expect from a reputable company. Honestly, Their machines are not reliable at all, even if you do all their maintenance recommendations with descaling and clean cycles and everything… I love their coffee, it’s the best, but because of their crappy machines, I will stop buying their coffee. A lot of people on YouTube are complaining about their machines too, leakage, blockage, stopped working, you name it. Bottom line: unless they start doing factory recalls on their defective machines, or work on better machines, don’t buy their coffee/products.I purchased great \"used\" Nespresso, understanding no box coming with item. It was advertised as coming with sample capsules. It did not and Amazon generously credited me. However, once set up, we saw there was no click in cup holder. It was OK, after all. My point is, your warehouse does not cross checkI ordered one of these and it took so long to get here, that I thought it had been lost in transit. So I ordered another one. They both arrived within 3 days. The first one I ordered arrived 3 days after I HAD RECEIVED THE SECOND ONE AND WAS TRYING TO USE it. So, I sent it back without opening it. My husband continued to try to use the other one. It isn\\'t working. Again and again, he tried to get it to work. Then he cursed and told me to send it back. So, here\\'s the deal. I\\'m sending the second one back, today. So, I ordered two of these Nespressos and As of today, I am sending the other one back. That makes two ordered, and now, two sent back. I hope this makes sense to you.My boyfriend and I are so happy we switched to Nespresso. The ease of making delicious coffee at home is unbelievable. What really makes it is the milk frother. Highly recommend!This is badass. I compare to my office espresso machine which is 2600 bucks... I am a barrista at work and make beautiful looking espresso creations... At home I hit a button and get an even better tasting espresso in no time.New favorite thing! Better taste, easier to use and refill water than other singles service coffee makers. Only con: Pods aren’t available in general stores (only manufacturers app, Amazon or speciality stores). Stopped my outside home coffee habit - prefer coffee from this machine instead. Great buy too. Saw same machine at speciality store for almost $200 more.I was really looking forward to getting this. Heard makes excellent coffee. However, the tank leaks horrible. My counter was soaked. I should have taken those reviews about leaking tank more seriously.\\n\\nI am revising my earlier review. The tank leak was my error for overfilling it to clean it. When making coffee with normal amount of water, no leaks. And it does make a wonderful cup of coffee.Best purchase! The coffee is the greatest I\\'ve ever had and it is so easy to use and clean! I can no longer go to a drive through coffee shop or get coffee anywhere other than home because the quality is just subpar. I saw this on sale at Bed Bath and Beyond and it was still more expensive than here on Amazon. So happy!I\\'ve owned two of Nespresso\\'s classic coffee machines. I like in particular the ability to use refillable coffee capsules, where I can use high quality expresso like Intelligensia\\'s Black Cat beans. The Vertuo coffee system of Nespresso was supposed to be an improvement on the classic system. Our experience with this machine has been anything but positive. My guess is that Nespresso is trying to suppress the customization of capsules, and require that all capsules be purchased directly from Nespresso. So, the idea is that Nespresso uses centrifugal forces (high speed spinning) to extract coffee... brewing parameters are adjusted for each capsule, using the barcode data to regulate the flow and volume of water, as well as temperature, infusion time and capsule rotation speed, which is a process Nespresso says helps to produce a rich crema. In fact, this machine consistently produces bitter, foul coffee (but the crema looks good). Cleaning doesn\\'t help, nor does any other adjustment documented in the manual. You can\\'t buy refillable capsules that allow you to use your own coffee, either ... this is probably the main reason that Nespresso switched to the Vertuo system. The older classical system has become hard to find, which was a big reason for taking a gamble on their new Vertuo system.I bought this Nespresso for my small office last year. We absolutely LOVE it! The coffee is wonderful. It started leaking/puddling and not working properly within a few months. We tried descaling a few times, to no avail. We ended up returning/replacing it (because we love it!). But within a few months again, we\\'ve had the same issues. And unfortunately we\\'re outside our return window. So we have had to go back to our tried and true Keurig. Coffee isn\\'t as good, and I loved the recyclable pods for the Nespresso, but I can\\'t afford to buy a new machine every 4 months :( The Keurig lasts forever.Every home should have one.It is an ok machine, convenient for an office. Unfortunately, Nespresso probably adds some foam agent to their coffees because the crema is simply excessive and it settles in a weired foamy residue after a a few minutes. Not very appetizing. Nespresso is not treating its customers seriously. I have addressed this issue with them and received a boiler response, lecturing me that I don\\'t know what I am takling about and that the foam is great....maybe some people like it....I simply scoop the foam and throw it away. Always need another cup to store it....\\nAdditonally, I ordered pods one week ago with \"second-day shipping.\" One week later, still no coffee and a \"blame shipping company\" response.\\nI am waitng for another company to pick up the slack. Nespresso apears to be a \"caring company\" on the surface, but it is not really concered with its customers\\' feedback. I have to say I had issues with a previous machine and they have not addressed them either. It was leaking right after the warranty expired.Works perfectly tastes amazing. Missing the cup holder... Not a big dealI gave it to my gf as a gift and she loves it. The flavors are amazing.\\nIf there was anything that might need improvement, they could consider a heat setting or a little hotter for those who like piping hot coffee. I don’t like it like that but some people do.\\nNo leak issues from ours. Will update periodically.It\\'s great I love itOur first Veruo Plus arrived broken. It did not open easily with one finger so we returned it and replaced it with this one. So far so good. Love making my lattes at home.We love our new Nespresso machine!I found it very slim, easy to use and doesn\\'t take too long. I wish it came with cups but that\\'s not a deal breaker for me.This thing is great. This has to be my favorite part of the morning. im giving it 4 starts only because i wish that were was a way to set a automatic timer to save me a few minutes in the morning but besides that i have no complaints.Very good durable and dependable🙂👍The product I received leaks sporadically. Sometimes it works flawless….sometimes there is a puddle of coffee on my counter. It’s like playing roulette every morning.AmazingPick the right pods for your flavor profile. Some extra dark ones are bitter, but the sampler kit was helpful to taste test.Super easy to use. I wish the pods were available in more stores. Pods are more expensive than other pod style machines on the market but these are extremely tasty. Worth the money.Makes greatest coffee ever! Everyone in the home has a different favorite coffee they make with it and love it!\\nOnly negative is the pods required for this espresso maker are ULTRA expensive.great machine. very useful while starbucks closed.Very easy to use and absolutely love this machine! The nespresso is very tasty and hot. If a lot of people are using this you have to fill the water frequently...but it is worth it.I am going to find it hard to be away from this machine!Everything about this is great, replaced my Keurig and do not miss itWe have tried a few different flavors and they are all too bitter to enjoy. I had tried the original machine a few years ago and the coffee was amazing so I thought I would purchase this more affordable version. I wish we had just purchased a Kuerig.I should have done more research before my purchase. This machine is quick and easy to make a good cup of coffee. I knew I would have to use only nespresso vertuoplus espresso pods and I was fine with that but I did not realize I can’t just pick them up at the grocery store or anything. They are hard to find and so you have to stay on top of pre-ordering them and there is not much of a selection.It started leaking coffee all over the countertop. We sent it back, and they fixed it. So far, it\\'s working again for about 2 months. Makes a great cup of coffee, when it works.By far the best coffee machine at this price. This is my second one. I bought this for friends who love it so much they are taking it on tour with their band. The flavor is like a $2000 coffee house cup but at just over a $100 dollar price. The bestTaste is great. There is so much flavor! It really makes thick crema. Finally went for it when I saw the price.Really nice product. I recommend 100 percent.Picture on Amazon website shows coffee maker with name \"De\\'Longhi\" printed at top of coffee maker. In fact, the name is not printed on the coffee maker. The Nespresso Vertuoplus Coffee and Espresso Maker in Silver sells at retail stores for $199.99 and includes the Aeroccino3 Milk Frother (which sells on Amazon for $80.00). So on Amazon the equivalent pair would cost $124.99+80.00=$204.00, not a better deal than retail. But the biggest difference is the size of the water container: While the water containers from both units mentioned are equal in height, the diameter of the water container on the unit purchased on Amazon measures 3.5 inches whereas the retail store version measures 4 1/8 inches in diameter (the wall thickness of both being the same. Finally while the Grey color looks nice on a computer screen the actual plastic grey container clearly announces that it is plastic and the color is what you would find in a garage more than a kitchen or home bar.Es bueno pero las cápsulas son muy carasDidn\\'t know it comes with 12 pods....WIN WIN\\nWorks wellI used this to make coffee & tea so far. Fun!! Recommend to add honey or sweeteners first & cream/milk & stir before processing the coffee in machine. So delicious & pretty presentation in glass mugs!!!The water tank came in very small. I used the tank from my old coffee pit.asked me to review it and then insist I write about it. Now the frother stopped working 6 months later.Bought for a deal on here for a Christmas present for my daughter. She was thrilled. I should have researched more. The pods for this machine are incredibly and stupidly expensive. She took it to work and only uses it as an Espresso machine; no coffee pods for her; and she loves coffee.Love!Bought Nespresso after trying a friends machine. Coffee was awesome! Easy to set up and use. Yes pods are expensive but worth it! Planning on getting another machine for daughter.El mejor café que he tomado a la altura de un restauranteBest espressoI love it. It heats up so quick. Best coffee machine!The pods are only a little more expensive, but the coffee is way better. Take advantage of the coupons Nespresso offers for the pods and you won\\'t be sorry.I’ve had this machine not even 24 hours and I’m already addicted. I’ve had three cups today already. Great machine, coffee comes out the perfect temperature, the taste is better than starbucks. In love!Great machine n also made a great gift.I loved this at first but it stopped heating the coffee after a month. Now I have to microwave coffee after I make it. We owned an original nespresso that still works.Greatest home coffee machine I’ve ever ownedI love it! Some of the coffees are too strong for me, but I like a lot of them. I really love the milk frothier.We love this machine. The coffee tastes amazing. We only use name prank pods and have had no problems with it.This Nespresso machine is the best coffee maker I\\'ve ever owned. The coffee comes out rich and flavorful and the machine looks beautiful on the countertop top!I hesitated on buying this model because I kept reading reviews on lukewarm coffee, but then there were others who claimed their coffee came out hot. Well, I just made three cups, and every single cup came out what I would consider below lukewarm. I even microwaved my coffee mugs so they were piping hot, and frothed the creamer, and it did absolutely nothing. As for me and my household, we only do hot coffee, unless we are drinking iced. I will also note, that when I put the middle pod in, which is an Altissio, barely anything happened, a few drops of coffee came out, and that was it. I’m thinking I may have received a used, or broken machine as well. When I received my package, it looked like the box was worn, weathered, and previously opened. The frother also does not do a very good job of frothing. I have another frother from Espressotoria, and it’s amazing. So, there’s my eperience with Nespresso Vertuo Plus. I think I will be trying out the Ninja Coffee Bar.have a Keureg at my shop, the Nesspresso stays at home !!!This is my second Nespresso VertuoPlus machine. The first machine (purchased November, 2019) began leaking coffee during brewing after 3 months use - Amazon promptly replaced the unit with a new device in January, 2020. The new machine began leaking coffee today, so I spent 62 minutes on the phone with a very patient and helpful Nestle associate, but after going through a significant number of repair steps, the machine continues to leak. So Nestle\\'s solution is to send me an empty box to return the unit for repair, but they do not have any loaners to use in the meantime! So I have 3-4 weeks of time where I have to buy another coffee machine to use in the meantime!! Where is the sense in that. I like the coffee from the Vertuo, but the reliability is extremely poor. noting what I know now, I would not knowingly purchase a Nespresso machine, nor do I recommend it to anyone else.it was a giftNow that I\\'ve watched a video on how to increase the water per cup to adjust the coffee strength I like the machine. Before that everything was TOO strong for me. Its very easy to use, doesn\\'t take up a lot of room and the red is perfect in my kitchen. Excellent price.I only use this machine to make 2 drinks a day 5 days a week and now it’s broken down with normal usage???My husband bought the nespresso vertuo plus for me for my birthday in December 2019. By June 2020 it\\'s leaking with every use. He saw that a few of the older models sold on Amazon had less than 4 star rating based on some durability issues, so he went with this version, which had a 4.5 star rating.\\nI used it a few times a week, mostly on the weekends, until I started working from home in March due to COVID-19. I loved the coffee and variety of pods available, but I am hugely disappointed in the quality of the machine. Given the volume of threads I found researching this issue - this is a systemic quality issue that has no \"home\" solution. After speaking with the customer service representative this morning, the only option is to send it in for repairs or replacement. It\\'s fine for now, it\\'s still under warranty, but I have no confidence that it will be usable long-term.This was a present for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it and spent the better part of a week perfecting the foam. She loves it! Great purchase.\\n\\nOnly down side is that the pods for the machine are a bit more pricey than a Keurig but I knew this going in.It works as advertised, sort of.\\nThe lukewarm espresso is a major downer. Recommendation from Support is to run hot water through the system by adding water to the \"Water Tank\" and pressing the brew button 3 times. This heats up the water and runs it through the system and out onto a large cup. At this point, the internals are supposed to be heated and therefore when you brew the espresso, it should be hotter. This was not the case. Espresso is still lukewam :(Absolutely love this machine!!It ain’t cheap. But it’s better.Makes a great espresso with cream! The frother works great, and works fast. Only downside is that you can’t find off-brand pods for this machine anywhere, you have to buy nespresso’s.Definitely not what I expected. I prefer dark roast from a keurigGreat coffee (so yummy) but 30% of the time, it doesn\\'t work. I put the capsule in and it only gives me hot water and I have to stop, put in a new capsule and do it again.Really like this coffee but the machine started leaking a little over two months of use. I had this problem on an older machine that I thought was just wear and tear over the years but now I am thinking it is a manufacturing issue. This product isn\\'t cheap and Im really disappointed so would say do not buy this product.If you\\'re currently using a keurig, then you have never had coffee. Throw your keurig away and buy this.\\n\\nKidding aside, this produces flavors 300% better than the best keurig. Only draw backs are limited selection of pods, absolutely no tea, and you can\\'t get just straight hot water from it. To tell the truth, I keep this machine and a keurig in my kitchen.Greatest invention ever been using this for the last year and a half and still love it!! I love iced espresso just to get the caffeine and go on my way its the perfect kitchen accessorylove itMy grandma really wanted this. So we got it for her as a gift she seems very happy with it. This machine is perfect! 1 touch open and close and 1 button brew! Brews 5 different sizes depending on the capsule you selected. Coffee is so strong and flavorful. You’ll love it!I’m CONSTANTLY having to reset to factory settings. One day it will brew the correct amount of coffee, the next it will maybe brew 5 oz or less. I call customer service and they say to reset machine. I have wasted so many coffee pods because it will go into cleaning mode instead of brew and literally brew the entire water container!!!! I’ve also had problems with the auto shutoff. I will get home in the afternoon and the coffee maker is still on and warm to the touch!!!! Maybe their newer machines have improved, but this Vertuo Plus by DeLonghi has been a headache! Let me add that the Nespresso Frother has been wonderful.Love this coffee maker. We have a keurig but this product makes a delicious cup of coffee or espresso. Would buy again!My home is in Ohio and my office is in Chicago. I can\\'t go a day without at least one Nespresso. Found this at a warehouse discount but came as new. I even got some of my associates hooked.Received broken and water poured all over. Wasted money buying capsules for a broken machine.If you like quality coffee, look no more. Going to a good coffee shop will set you back $5-7 while each capsule for this machine averages at $1. About 20 coffees at home and you got your money’s worth.\\nI got this one for my wife and she is very happy with it.The machine made great coffee until it didn\\'t. Exactly one month after the warranty expired, the machine started leaking copious amounts of brewed coffee from the bottom of the machine. I did a Google search that yielded hundreds of similar complaints. Taking the advice of one troubleshooter, I called the manufacturer. After being disconnected during the first call, I found an agent who tried to talk me through a fix over the phone, reading cheat notes from a company-issued binder, which meant that there was not much thinking outside-of-the-box going on. After 30 minutes of manipulating a toothpick, a toothbrush and warm sudsy water, we got nowhere. The final solution? Either send the $134.25 machine to get fixed for a fee of $125 or purchase a replacement machine at \"25% discount\"--which, by the way, was the exact same price listed on Amazon. Neither were solutions that I found to be acceptable. I can only thank my stars that I have my old Keurig still in the garage.The quality of this machine and Nespresso coffee is unsurpassed by any competitor. This is a great maker for small spaces or for those just starting out with espresso.so easy to use and super good coffeeThis thing makes great coffee if supervised properly. The first week or two it worked as advertised, then it started making however much coffee it felt like. So a $1.50 pod just made me 1.5oz of coffee instead of a 7.7oz cup. Tried a factory reset a few times and it would do 1-2 cups right and then messes up again.Stopped working correctly after 9 months!\\nSent a message to Nespresso customer service and haven’t heard anything back.I bought this when it was the deal of the day and I loveeeee it!!! Def worth what I paid for it. I use it all the time. It’s so easy to use and I love that it came with a bunch of samples for me to try. Def worth the buy!!!Makes a the best cup of coffee everNo problems so far.Read the reviews but took a chance anyway. After 5 weeks of use it started leaking. A week too late for Amazon to offer a replacement.exchange but offered a refund. Nespresso says it will take 2-3 weeks to get repaired. Will take the refund and get the older model.If you looking for coffee machine making lots of crema, this is it!! 1/3 of mug is crema!My daughter and her husband love theirs.I’ve had this less than a year and the water cylinder leaks all over my counter. I don’t know why and nothing is broken or cracked.Use it for every coffee imaginable!Love it!I love my new nespresso! Tasty coffee... I use to think a Starbucks was awesome but now I make my own yummy lattes and cappuccinos.EasyI have one Nespresso Vertuo machine, so I purchased the Vertuo Plus one for a vacation home. It didn\\'t work from day one. Nespresso has the absolute worst customer service. It was defective from the minute I opened the box. Nespresso didn\\'t respond to two complaints and only responded once I wrote on their Facebook page. Even then they said they couldn\\'t/wouldn\\'t help me and would defer to Amazon\\'s policy for returns. Fortunately Amazon took the machine back, although I had to pay a 20% restocking fee. I continue to enjoy the coffee/espresso from my original Vertuo machine, but will not purchase another from them because their customer service is so awful. Do not buy the Vertuo Plus. The Vertuo is a better machine.Great machine brews fastDo not buy this machine!!! First time I had nepresso coffee (expresso) was in the Netherlands at a family member’s house. My husband an I loved it! Two years later, had the coffee pod version at a friend’s house and decided I would purchase it! Bought it on Amazon, everything appeared to be in great working condition. Long story short, it leaked all over my counter. A couple of months later, started acting funny and found out it needed descaling. I bought descaling solution from Target, hoping this would resolve the issue, but it didn’t. After that, o decided it was taking up too much counter space, so I tossed in the garbage...yes the garbage. After reading reviews on this machine and the response individuals were giving, I thought it wouldn’t be worth my time and effort to ship it in for repair or replacement. Totally disappointed!Unreal! I had the previous Nespresso machine and this blows the other one away. A bit more for the cups, but so worth it. I would easily buy again and look forward to giving a few for Christmas. Rich, bold flavor and ease of use are easily the two best features. Biggest drawback is the cost of the pods, but still far cheaper than local coffee shop.This is my best luxury. I love having lattes at home. I select pods that are priced the most reasons only. The frother is powerful.Just purchased this. Have it about a week. Love it. The coffee is delicious, and easy to make. I was worried about caffeine and the coffee not being strong but that\\'s not an issue in fact I have to be careful how much I drink. Very happy with this purchase so farWonderful gift!! Amazing product!I love my Nespresso machine. It’s a whole different experience. The most civilized and minimal fuss coffee making expense ever. You will never return to regular coffee.Works. Love it. Got good price. Coffee taste Amazing. Buy it!LoveMachine works great. Thought there might be some leakage issues based on a couple of review but so far none. Process works and coffee is very good.We have loved the coffee and the milk frother!fast shipping, easy to set up and best coffee makerIf you really like coffee buy this. I bought it for my fiancee and she loves it.\\nThe flavor is unique.WORKED GOOD FOR HOME USEI use it every morning. It’s so easy and fast. Instead of making a whole pot of coffee every morning I just use this.So easy, tastes delicious, looks elegant, compact size, and blends perfect espresso. 8km very happy with this machine.Love the coffee maker, purchased as USED, so a great discount. I figured that since it was from Amazon it would be used in working order. The adjustable coffee arm plate was broken, but no big deal. The on switch only worked some times, to turn on the machine it needed to be plugged in and out from the wall. Then it may or may not make coffee. After 2 days, it wouldn\\'t turn on any more at all.\\nI did contact Nespresso direct to see if they had any ideas, and thank goodness it was still under warranty so they had me send to them ( free of charge) and they are repairing it at no cost. Should have it back in the next few days.\\nI would expect this type of USED product from Craigslist, but not from Amazon.This product is about to be a year old, and it started leaking :(This makes great coffee and does both coffee and espresso, which is very nice. The coffee, as pictured and depicted by the commercials, is frothy, which some are not used to or like, but it gives a nice detail to the coffee if you ask me. I tried several coffee types and will say if you go for the Intenso, watch out, it is STRONG!Love - Love - Love this coffee maker! The taste is amazing and the recyclable pods are a huge bonus. If you are a Kurig fan, you will be blown away by the taste of this coffee. It’s stronger, more flavorful and well worth the money.Great product a very happyLove it sooo much! Way better than wasting time stopping at a coffee shop!Bought this for my husband and he LOVES it!The top two aspects I look for in a coffee machine are quality and convenience. For quality, this machine is 8-9/10. For convenience, it is 10/10. I would pay twice as much for this. What\\'s more, the pods come right to your door and I\\'ve saved hundreds of dollars by not going to Starbucks/Dunkin\\' for a quick coffee.The Nespresso has been an excellent addition to my office. I can get a quality (yes I would say quality from a pod) espresso to pick me any time I need. I picked as a prime deal, I would do it again in a second. Highly recommend!This was a gift for my husband who uses it every day and loves it! He says he can now enjoy REAL coffee!Well it made delicious coffee while it lasted!.\\n\\nBut now the Nespresso Vertuo Plus has died after just 2 months of normal personal use.\\n\\nCompletely unacceptable for a product that holds itself out as a luxury item.\\n\\nNestle is sending me a replacement but I honestly question how much I want to keep investing in their system and coffee when I feel I cannot trust it.\\n\\nIf you MUST buy a Nespresso, do your homework on the best models, because this is not one of em. Or better yet, just learn to make espresso the real way and buy a machine that will outlive us all. No expensive proprietary pod system to buy into either.Very simple and straightforward device; it seems to taste much better than coffee from my Keurig prior to this. They also appear to run a recycling service via UPS for their pods so don\\'t throw them out.This was a gift for my hubby I could t wait to use myself so I didn’t wrap it I just put it right to work. Love it so much. I don’t go to Starbucks anymore coz I love my new machine! And way quieter than our old method.This Nespresso machine is awesome. I love it! But it’s not even 2 years old and it’s leaking from the bottomBought for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. Also uses the milk frother for hot chocolate.Speedy delivery love my expressoPackaged very nicely. Works great.This is by far the easiest and best tasting coffee we\\'ve ever had. This blows Keurig out of the water. It has less flavors available but they are all amazing and they provide FREE recycling of the pods.The Nespresso itself is labeled \"Delonghi\" in front; however the actual item is showing \"Nespresso\" instead.\\nFrankly I do not know where the machine was manufactured but Delonghi makes excellent coffee machines and so I am disappointed that the front of the machine isn\\'t labeled \"DeLonghi\"\\n\\n2019/05/01 -- Today is my 2nd day using this machine.. seems to be okay for now.Great coffee easy to use but pods are to expensiveFirst one leaded water. Seller instantly sent another that does not leak. This one make a bit more noise. Easy to use. Power lid is a nice touch. I enjoy this machineI purchased this as a gift for my fiancé’s birthday. It worked great for the first 3 or 4 uses. Then....nothing. The whole machine just stopped working. We did figure out we can open it to put another coffee pod in by unplugging and plugging it back in but it still wouldn’t actually brew any coffee. And it will shut off and we have to unplug it again. We’ve reset it and looked up other possible fixes and nothing has worked. I’ve reached out to customer service and haven’t come to a resolution. Pretty bummed with this purchase as we bought additional coffee pods and storage for a nice little coffee station and we can’t actually make any coffee.It was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.Awesome kitchen addition!The machine stopped working after 6 month. Amazon offered a contacting manufacturer option but after trying to contacting the manufacturer, we have gotten no response. Very disappointed.Much better than a keurig. the froth the machine makes is excellent! I really like the Espresso. Can\\'t find the pods in the store though... so I have to order them online.What a disappointment this machine has been. I waited years to buy one and had high hopes, but the coffee is sooooo bad, undrinkable. I\\'ve wasted a lot of money trying different blends but they all taste terrible. My guests tried it then snuck off to Starbucks. No one will even take it off my hands as a gift. JUNK.I got 2, one for me and one was a gift for my son, he uses this now more then the kcups, it is a better tasting coffee, the price of the coffee pods needs to come down some, and I hope it does and soon!Makes Great coffee!!!Excelente y me encanta la espuma que haceTrying different flavors of coffee looking for my favorite. This produces a clean coffee and so easy to use. I like this coffee machine.I really recommend this product to people who enjoy coffee, it is simple and easy to use. Makes a really nice coffee.I love this coffee machine! Great coffee without having to leave my home!💝I absolutely love this espresso machine! I have owned several keurigs and none of them have come close to the coffee this makes.Making my coffeeBest purchase of 2020.I’ve saved a fortune by making my own coffee drinks. Love this little Nespresso!It\\'s a nice product. The espresso is really good. The design, color options are also good. Overall, happy with product.Love this machine. Makes a great cup of coffee and has a nice layer of froth on top with every cup.I love this coffee maker its amazingWhen it works, it’s great. Three months of use and the water began leaking under the machine. The pdf file under the order’s customer support had me descale the machine. I used 1/3 white, distilled vinegar in the reservoir and let it cycle through wash and rinse. Green lights from there. I had been trying the MyCaps silicone top and filters. Don’t bother with them, as they are more trouble than they are worth, and may have contributed to the machine’s problem. We shall see.\\nAfter eleven months of wrestling coffee out of this machine, it gave up. All unused capsules will be gutted and transferred to my Keurig.The coffee tastes good. It\\'s very very loud. We think it must be defective.Up until this point I was under the impression. I would need to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to get a solid espresso machine.\\n\\nNow that I have this, it’s completed my life. Two shots every morning and I love it.After only 10 cups of coffee, capsule does not eject. Frothier shuts off before milk is fully frothed even though i followed instructions by filling only to the line specified for hot and/or cold frothSo. First of all. I\\'m a barista.\\n\\nThis machine- is literally the best thing I\\'ve ever purchased. Legit. Its amazing.Great product! The coffee comes hot, delicious flavor and tastes wonderfully creamy.What a difference of Nespresso vs Keurig. Enjoying every bit. Depending on your taste or mood, your can choose how strong the cup you want. Whether it’s coffee or espresso (which you cannot make with Keurig) it’s perfect cup with a delicious crema.Greatly simplifies our morning routineOne step use and automatic cleanup! All I have to do is load the pod and press a button. People who like bold coffee flavors (and not watered down coffee some places offer) this is for youLove, love love my new Nespresso. The coffee taste better than the coffee I spend $5 a cup for at the finer coffee houses.Got this for my granddaughter to take to college. She tried it out and it makes great coffee! Very easy to use!This is an answer to \"I have no time for a coffee shop!\". When I need a mid-day pick-me-up, this makes a great cup of either coffee or espresso. Since narrowing down the varieties I enjoy, the experience has become a highlight of a busy day.\\nNothing bad to say, as of yet. Love the coffee it makes.I read a review before I bought one and someone said, \"throw out your Keurig\". They weren\\'t kidding. Love the flavor.I am giving this product only 2 stars cause I am not in position to use it straight away as I received since there was no complimentary pack of 12 capsules in package, although it is mentioned in product description. Also the package content on the box is saying that with machine you are to receive complimentary gift of 12 different coffee flavors capsules. If I knew that, would order coffee separately in order to receive together with machine.The coffee is OK but those cords!!! They don\\'t show you those in the pictures but they are huge, long industrial sized cords that you can\\'t hide or wrap around something. That plus the too expensive pods are why I am giving it three stars. The cord I have pictured is from the frother, the coffee machine has basically the same cord so you get to deal with both cords.\\nEdit\\nI bought this in 2017 and just broke it out after a couple of years of not using it. Now I remember why I quit using it, the coffee is barely hot, I drink it black and even at that it needs to go in the microwave for 30 seconds. I am lowering review to 2 stars.Machine broke after having it one month. To get it repaired will take a minimum of 2 weeks. Unfortunately return window closedGreat selection of flavors. But needs better availability in stores other than its own.Absolutely amazing. No steam self cleaning. Very hot and just perfect overall.Thankfully we had tried this out in a store first. If you have guests maybe include some directions on there. But makes delicious coffee.I literally can’t wait for the next\\nMorning so I can wake up and have a delicious cup of coffee.. I haven’t gone to Starbucks in months hahaNespresso is really good and fantastic for making iced coffee. I had tried many of k-cups but the flavors were always very weak and not great. This stuff is wonderful.This is the best espresso system yet. Better than earlier Nespressos because it provides different pods for different serving sizes. Makes great espresso.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that there are not any real strong coffee blend pods available in decafOnly had it for a few weeks but I like it so far. It’s plastic but I knew what I was getting beforehand. Best part is the great tasting coffee. My hubby doesn’t like coffee but he is now craving an espresso everyday.I loved my machine but it broke after only 5 months of light usage. Nespresso is a nightmare to contact so we now have a broken machine.First of all, the coffee is fantastic! Deeply flavorful, great foam, just terrific. I love the pod catcher in the back and the streamlined look. It is easy to use and when I\\'m away I miss it!Fantastic product! I can\\'t compare to any other machine since this is my first ever Nespresso but all I can say is that I\\'m very satisfied with it\\'s functionality. Very easy to use and for the price you can\\'t go wrong.I bought this machine as a Christmas gift for my wife last november, our first Nespresso after years of asking for one! After only four months of not daily use started leaking, search online and it seems to be a regular issue. Contacted customer service run troubleshoot and needs repair but... my warranty was void because I shipped the gift to our home in Venezuela. By the way the machine was shipped in its original packaging and was open for the first time in our home since I used a door to door service. I understand that fees to get it to the US and back should be covered by me but don\\'t bother, warranty is void. I\\'m still looking the warranty specification since is the first time I hear something like this. Thanks Nespresso, a very fast way to lose my money.Easy to use and makes the best coffee!needs larger water capacityI love my Nespresso!!!love the coffee price for pods to highDidnt expect to love it this much !!!! The coffee is like a cup from a cafe!I bought this after I started drinking this at my boyfriend\\'s house and never looked back. All my other coffee machines got tossed in the trash. This is all you need. Easy, and amazing coffee. I love this machine.This is a great coffee machine. Fell in love with Nespresso when I went to the store for a cuppa and now I\\'m a fan. The coffee comes out hot, rich, aromatic, and I love the foam on top! If you want to splurge a little, buy this!I bought the Nespresso coffee maker with the Aeroccino frother. The frother arrived missing mixer (whisk) and frothing spring. I sent a request for to contact me online but after a week I have gotten no response. I again went online to see if I could try again for assistance. The USA website has NO WAY to contact them except by phone or snail-mail. What the heck is that all about??? Now, I will say the coffee is pretty good, but the extra cost for a useless plastic cylinder, when I wanted to be able to add warmed, frothed milk to the coffee really has me steamed. If you simply want the coffee, save the money and buy a unit without the frother.Really good coffee. Only thing I don\\'t like is that you can\\'t use it without a coffee podEasy to use and makes a cup of coffee quickly. The frother is easy to use and easy to clean.Works as expected. Milk frothier works well but does not produce micro foam. More whipped ‘peak’ foam with milk at the bottom. Still like it for latte.\\nNo 3rd party coffe capsules yetThis machine is great! I purchase my pods directly off Nespresso\\'s website, and I add in the recycling bag so I don\\'t have to throw them out! Also, each pod is only about $1, and the coffee is delicious.I got it the machine works perfectly.The machine arrived with a box of free samples in perfect condition and a booklet for other Nespresso pods available. I am completely impressed with how well this machine works! I typically do not like machines on my countertops but this one is so elegant and takes up very little space.Best coffee machine I’ve ever purchased. This makes amazing coffee, you’ll never be disappointed. I’ve gone through so many pods, because I can’t stop drinking this coffee. Stop thinking about buying this and just get it, I promise you won’t regret buying this Nespresso.I had a Nespresso machine for 18 years. It finally guit. We didn’t need a fancy one so we chose this one. It is so cheaply made! I can see why my original one lasted so long. The water container is really cheap plastic bi don’t expect this machine to last 3 years let alone 18 years. It’s easy to use I like the new way of expelling the capsules. I am afraid that if I dropped any part it would break. I don’t care if I can get replacements. I saw this model when I was in Germany. It was not so cheaply made. Not satisfiedI make different flavors and espresso coffee few times a day for me and my husband. My friends say the best coffee is the one we serve This machine worked wonderfully right up until it got stuck in descaling mode now it’s more worthless than a bleeding paperweight. The Nespresso web site people just tell you to follow the instructions in the manual that didn’t work before I contacted them. I have never been more disappointed in a purchase in my life... Be warned this thing is a expensive chunk of junk.\\n\\n2days later.... I finally got on to a different customer service rep who actually knew how to get my coffee pot out of the descale mode took about 1 1/2 hours and one hell of a long phone call but it\\'s back up and running. Will sell it soon and get something that\\'s not so complex all I want is good coffeeWouldn’t recommend this machine to anyone. We have owned ours 4 MONTHS and it’s not working at all. The “start” button is mushy, you can’t always tell you pushed it correctly. The owner’s manual isn’t real helpful - very general instructions and didn’t address our problem at all. We looked for videos on our machine to see if we could find something. The one video we found was a man experiencing the same problem, long story short, he didn’t resolve it either.\\n\\nWe are having to buy another machine and it WAS NOT this brand!Love love love it makes the best cappuccino and coffee. Have not used my Keureg in a month.I have bitten 2 of these machines in the last 2 year. Both have died. I only make one cup a day. The coffee was good when the machine worked. It should last much longer I got insurance on the second one and they are sending me a gift card for $89 AFTER I return the broken machine. DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE. DO NOT BUY IT FROM AMAZON. I went to the Nespresso web site and bought a new machine from them.Perfect.I love the Nespresso machine so far and the color is perfect. However, I have a serious problem with the shipper Auroras Australis. I ordered the full bundle pack of the VertuoPlus and Aeroccino Milk Frother by De\\'Longhi, for a considerable amount of money. The Aeroccino was not included in the shipment and no explanation was provided. When I contacted the seller, they offered a $20 refund (for a $90 item) or I could return the coffee maker. What I\\'d like is a better refund or the Milk Frother and I don\\'t understand why they won\\'t cooperate.\\nIf they can\\'t provide the entire package, I am entitled to an appropriate refund - I really feel like they are ripping me offOnce I figured ito out it is very easy to use and now have my dayly cup and love itGreat machine! Replaced a Keurig with this machine and love it! Easy to clean and coffee taste great!I absolutely love this machine and haven\\'t been back to Starbucks since I got it. I feel absolutely spoiled every morning now and am happy every single day that I bought this. I\\'ve had mine for 4 months now.Easy setup. Like movable water reservoirThe coffee tastes great and love the foam top. It\\'s quick brewing and looks nice on the countertop. (I\\'m not a fan of leaving kitchen equipment out so this matters to me). However, we are on machine #2 and this one is leaking just like the first. Nothing like walking away while your coffee is brewing to return to a mess all over the counter. Not a fan. I\\'m not interested in troubleshooting a brand new machine.Box was banged up and opened.Delicious coffee but had to return two days later because water started leaking from the bottom.Great machine. Close to authentic brew. Love the crema given from each brew. Take my advice only buy authentic capsules.The coffeemaker was purchased new, but came apparently used, in damaged and worn box and did not work from the start. It was shipped back and refunded. The seller should be ashamed to ship products in this condition.Makes delicious coffeeMakes great gourmet coffee!! Just wished it made it a bit hotter. But it will taste excellent!We didnt always get a full cup of coffee, it was hit and miss. Now our machine is broken even after cleaning it and watching videos to help. Trying to return it!Very easy to usu, make a good espresso.Like being a millionaire with State of the art gadgets lolThis is easy peasy & brews a delicious cup of coffee. I like the variety of serving sizes. Plus the coffee pods are recyclable too. Nespresso now offers free shipping on coffee orders of $35.00. Yeay!Obsessed with this machine! So easy and the quality is superb. Love the milk frother. You literally don’t have to do anything except pour the milk in the frother, pop in a pod, combine and enjoy.Love this coffee maker\\nCoffee tastes great\\nPods are expensive thoughCoffee has great taste with kinda froth on top. The froth is in the coffee, you do not have to make it separate.We love Nespresso, so when they came out with a new coffee line we had to order one and it does not disappoint. We have had their original line for over a decade.The frothier is not frothing the almond milk sufficiently. When I refill the water tank it leaks water into the coffee cup before the coffee brewsMost flavorful coffee out of a machine. One of my big objections to Keurig, other than the weak flavor, is the waste represented by the pods. Nespresso will provide at no charge a mailer bag for you to recycle the pods. Conscience cleared. Great coffee and espresso.This is truly a great machine and delicious coffee. I use it to make cappuccino and I love it.I ordered this nespresso machine with a bandle that contains machine and capsules, they sent me the capsules immediately, but for the machine I waited more then month, in the meantime I lost the capsules, and it was very disappointing.\\nThe machine actually looks like a medium-low quality, if I m going to buy a coffee machine I prefer to pay more and get something good enough.I bought this during a holiday special after my 3rd disappointing verismo. The pods are a little spendy but delicious. They send you a bag to recycle all of your old pods. Just drop off with ups along side your Amazon return 😂.Makes a great cup of coffee or Espresso. My only complaint ( not the product) is the delivery driver feels the need to just drop it on the porch, as opposed to setting the box down.Great coffee and easy to use. Couldn\\'t be more pleased.I missed my Nespresso coffee when my other machine died. Glad to have this new one!Not much about this product we dislike, the only exception is the availability of the pods. They are not anywhere in stores to purchase you have to order off the Nespresso website or Amazon.Seriously this has ruined me. I had a Kuerig before and that was fine, but the quality of coffee shooting out of this thing is far superior than anything I tasted on the Kuerig. The coffee is more expensive than I am used to but it\\'s well worth it.I bought this nespresso machine for my 5th wheel camper. I have a more expensive model at home and this one does just as good as the more expensive model for a better value.Coffee was go great at home, I could not stand the taste of the swill that work has. So I ordered one for my office. Can\\'t go wrong......just for when I want ONE really good quality cup of coffee! I find it’s so rich & the frothiness replaces the need for 1/2 & 1/2 , which has been great for my diet!Love the ease at which you get a great cup of espresso or cappuccino, it’s easy to clean as wellI didn’t realize that I have to flush a tank full of water every week to keep the coffee tasting decent. I’ve only had it six weeks and about every three weeks, the coffee starts to taste sour. I called the Nespresso club number and she had me factory reset the machine and told me that they recommend the weekly flushes because these machines are “sensitive”. I don’t know...it was cool in the beginning but I’m now regretting this purchase. My friend has the same machine, but she didn’t even have to flush it once (she’s had it for 3-4 months).Still using it and its a great product!This machine did make great tasting coffee. But, after only one month it started to leak somewhere inside and came through the bottom with water and mold. I was worried about purchasing this machine in the beginning because of the mixed reviews both here and YouTube reviews. Back to a Keurig.The machine is easy and fun to use, and the coffee is divine. The pods can be purchased directly from Nespresso if you are looking for better deals and diversity. I\\'m hooked.Makes great coffe! Pods bullets expensive!This makes the best tasting coffee and espresso. I can’t believe we waited this long to ditch the Keurig.the best coffee you can make at homeA new way to enjoy your favor blend of coffee at home and at anytime!!More than six months in, and no issue! Love the coffee it makes. Hands down a great purchase!The best coffee flavor you will ever experience.It’s good and durableThe coffee this makes is amazing. Only complaint is that I wish it had a cup setting so I didnt have to brew the same pod three times to fill my cupGot this as a gift for my sister and she loves it. She says the coffee is the best she has had but the kids are expensive and hard to findI had the Nespresso Espresso Maker and I felt like it was too small a cup of coffee to start the day. This Coffee maker makes the perfect size cup for my morning coffee. Love it.I wanted a Nespresso machine and this came up for a lightening deal. I was not disappointed. It is a slim design so it doesn\\'t take up too much room on your countertop.I bought this to replace a Breville Nespresso Machine which took up more counter space, so I had the opportunity to compare them directly. The Breville Nespresso machine produced a much thicker crema and a better tasting coffee than this DeLonghi machine did. With the green-colored coffee pods the crema on the Breville was nearly two inches thick, while the DeLonghi produced barely half that. I suspect that the Breville spins the pods faster and with more force, or at least it sounds that way. The Breville coffee had more body while the DeLonghi coffee was noticeably flatter.The machine came with fails and not working. The press botton on the top did not not work and the coffee did not flow. That is the reason I had to return the product to seller SHIBO on Jan/14th.\\nUp to now (Jan/20th) I have no answer about the return . Please give me some position about itTried this unit at a friend\\'s house. I\\'ve been using it for over 6 weeks now and still love it. The foam on top of every cup is a treasure.This is the best coffee/coffee maker I’ve ever had! Soooooo good!!!Makes a better cup of coffee than a hat you could pay $7 for at your local high end coffee shop!love the rich coffee. So good.Miles ahead of my Keurig, but I feel like it\\'s not brewing as well as it did with the first few amazing cupsWorks wonderfully. Great machine. Perfect size and brewI love that it\\'s easy to use and the coffee taste great. The only down for me is where they water cylinder is located, its just a bit awkward. Overall, I love it!Great coffee. Easy recycling through the company. Don’t miss the companion app. Delivery is super fast.Having a little trouble sometimes it stops and I have to re starded a few times to complete a full cupEasy to use and to clean. I love that it is cheaper than buying coffee out everyday. The coffee quality tastes 10 times better too! A great investment for sure!Works great! It\\'s fast and easy. When I first wake up, I can stumble into the kitchen and press a button, and coffee. Now.The Nespresso is amazing. Extremely easy to use. The Coffee and Espresso drinks taste amazing!Some of the best coffees I have had from an at home system. A little pricey per cup, but well worth it!Decided to try the used version. To my surprise it was in pristine condition with a little dent on the box! Super easy and perfect for the value. So excited to try the different capsules.I\\'m, not interested, \"in the morning\", standing in front of the coffee machine, holding the brew button while the machine does it\\'s thing. It should make a decent cup of coffee at a single press of a button.I prefer my Nespresso coffee rather than Starbucks. The coffee is so smooth and favorable.Un understand to use it or change the coffee size, it was missing the milk steamer itemMy wife going crazy with this machine,....is not a machine is a bomb in the coffee ..Just FYI this was delivered in a box with a picture of it on the outside. Christmas surprise was ruined for my teenager. :(The VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker by De\\'Longhi is really nice. Quality made. Easy to use, easy to clean. This make a great cup of coffee.Awesome cup of coffee! Need more flavor options in alto size.Love it! Everyone that comes over wants to use it and they love it!Play Video\\n I really enjoyed my Nespresso maker. However, within a year the machine started to leak from the back. I’m very disappointed and the process to have it repaired is lengthy and inconvenient. Not sure I would buy another one.Purchased for my son for his birthday. He loves it!This machine was worth every penny buy it already.Amazing. Easy to use!!This is what you need in life!!!!Lovely coffee maker! One glaring issue, I can\\'t find the pods in any store locally. I just can\\'t get on board ordering coffee from the manufacturer, it\\'s killed the experience. However, the coffee quality is superb, tastes great and easy to use the machine.Love this so much don’t know what took me so long to buy it!Happy with the productFrom what I understand the Aeroccino should have had two whisk. Mine only has one. I can froth milk, but the other whisk was supposed to be a light froth or for heating the milk only. Quess I\\'ll have to buy an extra whisk since I can\\'t find out how to contact the seller.Love it! Everything about it. Easy to use and clean. Bulkier than the regular Nespresso line but so worth it. There’s something for everyone.no dislikes at all with this productMy favorite machine in the house. Cant live without it. Easy to use and clean. Its the espresso-ly perfect sizeGood machine. Very big pods. The creamy top looks like foam. It is diferente the a normal espresso. I don’t like it but if you want take a shot, you can return if you don’t like it. That is what I did. And I bought a original line.Nespresso is the best! Throw your Keurig away and get this! Plus these pods recycleWow, this machine makes some seriously good coffee. I love how the water chamber holds so much water and I don’t have to refill it very often. No problems with this machine. It is very easy to use.I recommend this if you want the best tasting coffee. The pods cost more than Keurig pods but taste way better.What an awesome coffee and espresso machine. Nespresso is a coffee game changer. The machine arrived in perfect condition and was easy to assemble. One of my best purchases.Looks great, bought used but it looks new.The perfect cup of “treat” coffee. Smooth, flavorful & the foam lasts to the last drop! I add a little caramel on top. Love this coffee maker!!!The unit was less than 6 months old when it started developing a leak. I have Emailed their customer service twice and received no response so I had to get Amazon rep involved to get a Nespresso rep on the phone. After spending an hour on phone, the rep was finally convinced that the unit was defective and told me that the unit would have to be shipped for a repair. She said the repair would take two weeks, not including the time in transit. No loaner unit, or replacement and she insisted that the unit be repaired. Now I need to spend next two + weeks with no coffee maker, and Nespresso has absolutely nothing to offer.Great machine. Works wellMy Nespresso VertuoPlus machine quit working after 45 days of using it only once a day. Now it doesn\\'t brew using the proper amount of water resulting in quite a mess on my counter top I contacted customer service through Amazon and because it was outside the 30 day return window they could only refer me to the Delongi website to be told i could not get a replacement for 3 months due to a computer chip shortage. My coffee pods will be old by then! Very frustrated and disappointed.I have an original Nesspresso Citzi and Milk machine that I have for over 10 years. It has been great. No problems at all. It was time to buy a new machine. I was really hoping the Vertoline would be just as dependable. However, the seller sent me a used machine. The packaging wasn\\'t even sealed. I didn\\'t take it out of the box. You could tell just by looking at it that it was either a return or display model but not factory new. I wasn\\'t going to waste my time to see if it would work. I love the Nesspresso machines and unfortunately this seller this not doing Nesspresso any favors.Very happy with this purchase. So quick and easy to use. And the coffee is delicious, in contrast to several other coffee machines we have tried. Highly recommend!Wow!!! You’ll never buy Starbucks againThis machine makes the best coffee ever. The pods are pricey, but it’s well worth it! I don’t think I’ll be able to do Keurig again.It never brews the correct amountGreat machine great coffee everything is greatMe encanta esta máquina...There is nothing to say\\nit’s fabulous! I love my morning coffeeGreat buy and works good best cup of coffee everLove it. Slightly leaks if bumped but not a huge deal. My kids and I make mochas all the time with it and I love the coffee!Makes an amazing cup of coffeeWorks like a charm! Was afraid about noise and leack, but everything is ok...for now, will see 😄Ordered this machine in July, it is now October and the machine has gone mad. It will start brewing by itself, spilling water/coffee every where. It will not recognize any programming size for coffee capsules, it will brew a capsule until until you hit stop.. It fills 2 and a half cups sometimes and sometimes it brews normal. Very disappointed with how fast this machine got faulty. I want a replacement because I love the Nespresso coffee.Love this thing!I love how nicely this machine froaths coffee! Feels like I’m drinking high end quality espresso every time. Pods are kind of pricey but a great machine.Looks great and brews a fantastic cup of coffee.This machine does a great job. The coffee pods are a little pricey.After only 15 months of use, my Nespresso Vertuo Plus started leaking coffee from underneath the machine, leaving a puddle of coffee between the bottom of the machine and my countertop. Amazon was unable to help me get it repaired or replaced. I can\\'t abide throwing it away and spending another $200 for a product that only lasts 15 months.I received the machine and it never worked. I returned it after one hour with the customer care. I bought another one, it\\'s dead after one year.Love this coffee maker. Nespresso coffee is amazing in flavor.More dependable and taste just as good as our original line.Easy to use!Bought this for my husband because he wanted it...now I use it more than him! It is wonderful for relaxing with a latte on the weekends!This was a replacement for the same exact item which stopped working after two weeks. During the time the first one worked, I really enjoyed the coffee. Then the one and only button wouldn’t respond at all. So I exchanged the machine for this one, same exact machine, and this one didn’t even work out of the box. It would power up but again the one and only button did not work. After a call with Nespresso they said it sounds like defective wiring. Having had two bad experiences in a row I returned this for a refund. Perhaps try another brand like Breville.We love it. Get clear mugs and watch how beautiful the coffee is layered.GoodLove itHave owned Nespresso machines for a long time. Last one stopped working after 2 years. Ordered this new one however coffee leaks.\\nCalled service department not helpful. Returning to Amazon and as usual great service.this make the best coffee easy to use and the frother is awesome, Masy\\'s carries the pods, $1.10 each\\nps you can use each pod twice, second cup is less strong but fine.I am trying very hard to reach out to someone regarding this item. This is the second Nespresso machine that I have purchased for our office and yet it is stopped working again. I added a warranty and yet I can get no assistance with a replacement. I would greatly appreciate it if someone were to refund us the money or send another Nespresso machine. The coffee is great when it works!Absolutely amazing. All the espressos are delicious!I am highly disappointed in my product. If there is something out of stock the pull the item from the list so guy don’t disappoint anyone else. I did lot of research and Chose this model AND the frother was a bonus... yet it didn’t come with a frother and I was offered 20 dollars off. First it was “our packers double check to make sure everything is there and maybe it was lost” THEN it was “sorry it’s out of stock” Uhm no.... I want what I paid for now I’m left no choice but to return it. Thanks for the inconvenience!We love it. Still havent fogured out the best iced coffee recipe but otherwise we love it. Nice and compact, easy to use, great tasting coffee.Love the Nespresso line coffeeIn normal operation this makes great coffee. After a time, by design, you will get an error indication that it\\'s time to descale and shortly your machine will stop making coffee until you do. Chuck the Nespresso instructions and find a youtube video for your machine and follow along. There are only two controls, the cup button at the top and lever at the front. Sometimes you need to press them at the same time but other times separately. Sometimes you need to press the for a long (3s) time but other times just a tap. The machine state needs to be decoded from a multi-colored ring that blinks with different colors and different rates. If you are color-blind you may have a problem. My machine had been back to the company three times to be fixed before they gave me a new one with a shortened warranty. This required 4 or 5 phone calls of at least 30 minutes each. I\\'ve been using this machine for 18 months and still need to go to youtube to make it work sometimes. Also, don\\'t stockpile a large number of pods because if you get frustrated and decide to trash the machine you could be stuck with hundreds of dollars of coffee pods you can\\'t use.Super-nice coffee maker. It really does everything the ads say. The crema is so good! The milk frother works perfectly, too. Also, this combo is much cheaper than you will find in retail stores like Williams-Sonoma.Works great but location of water tank can be a hassle if space is at a premiunThis coffee maker started leaking after a few weeks. Apparently this a problem with this model. I have contacted the seller to get troubleshooting help but haven’t heard back.This is vertuo plus not deluxe,\\nSo i started return immediatelyLove the machine, easy to work, shipping fast, frother is having problems and errors out.Excellent product! Coffee tastes really different from this machine. You would never go back to regular coffee ever. Every pod is brewed to perfection with.I have had nothing but problems with this machine ever since I bought it. It worked fine for a few weeks but after that the lid won\\'t open sometimes for 10 minutes at a time. It at least once a week will just endlessly pour water into a cup when I am trying to make coffee and the only way to stop it is to unplug it. Not sure what the problem is but I DO NOT recommend this product AT ALL.My daughter bought it for college n loves itMakes a great espresso every time!So far so good. Love the beautiful packaging and the foamingWe LOVE this. It does vibrate when making a cup, but that is to be expected. Only other thing is; they should have made the cup tray bigger. Those are the only cons. Every other aspect is GREAT!!!Very disappointing device. The product was delivered on time. I was away in Israel and I was back used it for a few weeks and then it just stopped working. The company does not want to replace the product.\\nI highly recommend not to buy this coffee makers. Not reliable..There are much better products in the market.Water container started leaking. Then it stopped!Great product and a Great price!!! My son loves it!!!bought as employee gifts they are absolutely wonderful. they love itHands down, worth the money! Delicious, frothy coffee. Easy to use, no mess. Had for several months and never have had a problem.If you only need a machine for 12 months this is fine. Longer than that ... This was my 2nd Nespresso machine and now my last. Both started massive leaking hot coffee out the back at 14 months. Both times customer service told me I was SOL. Out of warranty.The best tasting coffee ever. So easy and quick. Cost is prohibitive for supplies so it\\'s a treat rather than everyday coffee. But truly deliciousI love this choice coffee machine. A little pricey to use all the time. I use it as a treatQuit working after a little over a month. Nespresso fixed it and provided a loaner while they did. I feel they should have replaced the unit because now, it doesn\\'t brew coffee as hot as it did when it was new.Works great!Love this amazing machine. I get “fancy” coffee drinks everyday.This was an awesome deal very good machineAbsolutely the best coffee machine. Makes the freshest coffee and espresso I’ve ever had in the comfort of your own home. Definitely worth the money and would recommend to others.This is how my box arrived. Just like this! I’m hoping the machine isn’t damaged when I open it. And I was quite disappointed that it wasn’t in a plain box because now my husband knows what he’s getting. Literally open.The coffee flavor, quality and taste are superb! The only downside is that I wish the pods were more available instead of just online.I purchased this unit through a reseller, not from Amazon. After going through the recommended set-up procedure the unit displayed the solid red error light. I contacted Nespresso directly who walked me through the troubleshooting procedures; unplug and retry after 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and overnight. Each try failed and Nespresso recommended the unit be returned. After returning the seller claimed the unit worked fine and charged us a $77 return/restock fee. I will no longer be purchasing higher priced appliances or other equipment from resellers as they can\\'t be trusted.Best purchase I\\'ve made in my life. In loveThe flavors of the coffees are great!!I love how quick I can make a non-Nespresso pod cup of coffee with this machine😉, and the froth machine froths coconut milk - keeps me vegan and losing weight.Awesome taste, but could be hotterThe machine works great but the cup platform is too small for the cups most people use today. We use the larger cups that fit fine under our Keurig machine but hang a tiny bit over the edge on this one. Coffee is great though!Delicious coffee, more than I expected. Bought a heavily discounted one from warehouse deals and didn’t know what to expect. Pleasantly surprised!Machine did not workThis coffee is delicious. The milk frother is a must! Nespresso coffee is strong, defiantly for a coffee lover.My husband loves the nespresso machineThis machine worked wonderfully for about 3 months... it developed a leak during brewing, leaving half the coffee in the cup, the other half on the counter. A Google search revealed this problem is very common with the model. Sent into Nespresso support; they returned it 5 days later with a part replaced. The \"fixed\" machine sounded like a lawnmower, with loud rattling and vibrating. On the first cup brewed, the machine still leaked - coffee made it to the cup, but now water spilled everywhere. So frustrating... had to buy a new model (Evoluo). To Nespresso\\'s credit, they credited me the cost of the new machine and sent some coffee pods, too.I love this great espresso machine.I Don’t drink coffee purchased it for my wife and she loves itThe coffee and machine were great until it stopped working about two weeks short of owning it for two years. After spending an hour on the phone with Nespresso service who had me running through the cleaning cycle, factory resetting, and descaling, it still didn\\'t work. They said I could have it repaired for $125 or buy a new one for 35% off. Not very helpful.Bought it for a Christmas present, will let you know, she might not want to buy the pods they r a bit pricey.Coffee is great. Pod availability is limited to Nespresso stores only. Machine broke 2 months after warranty was up. Stuck with pods I can\\'t use, or spend another $150 on a maker. This sucks.Best espresso machine ever....Love the coffee this machine makes.Love it. Had mine for 4 months and no issues. I wish the reservoir was larger. Makes mornings easier.Gift for my mom and she loves itoI bought this for my sister for Christmas and she was blown away. It works great and she really loves the milk frauther.I am officially addicted to coffee now !!Really nice coffee maker and nice design. Was a really good deal and very happy with it.Careful the water tank will leak all over counter. Otherwise amazingWater overflows with each use.So far so good, although i wish i got the one with bigger water tankEasy to useNo problems at this time. Have made about 20 cups so far. Love the frother, even used it for iced coffee.I\\'ve had this for jut over a year. It\\'s been in for repair twice and it\\'s dead- again! You have to get special pods and it became a hassle for me. I do not recommend this product!!!This machine is quality built and makes great coffee every time, simple to use.So easy and tasty. Lattes for days❤❤❤I start every morning with a well blended coffee.The whole set is worth the money !Gave this to our adult daughter and she loves it. Brews a great cup of coffee and the milk frother works great.Great productCoffee comes out with too much foam - it should not be like that. Expresso doesn\\'t taste as good as one from a true pump expresso machine. What comes out is not quite coffee and not quite expresso, but something in between.Best coffee machine I have ever had. The best coffee I have ever drank from a home machine.The box came open and machine had previously been used. Looks like the person who bought it before me realized the machine was broken and returned it. Has a leak and coffee gets spilled all over while preparing. Amazon didn’t verify the product was damaged before shipping it out again even though they sold it as a new item.Recommend you purchase directly from nespresso. I received the wrong item and was directed to several agents to process the claim before eventually getting in touch with amazon for a refund once I returned item. Was not offered option to have replacement sent. Very frustrating and can be avoided by purchasing directly though nespresso.Gift for my son. He loves it!Got a killer deal on Black Friday but major upgrade from my current kureig. Super streamlined use on this nespresso machine, very easy.seems usedI love coffee , and drink about 4 cups a day......but after a couple of weeks with this nespresso machine , I raffled it off to my employees as a Christmas gift, and went back to my old friend, Keurig.\\n\\nFor me a few problems (although one woman in our office loves hers). Like I never could find a flavor I liked; two, the refills are awfully expensive ; and well, I guess there isn’t a third! I would just add , not a good product for “regular coffee drinkersAlways lots of coffee in the capsule reservoir & never the proper volume in the cup. They said it would update with the app & fix that. Never happened. Then, 2 months after purchase, it started leaking all over the counter. Too late to return, it’s trash now.This was an amazing anniversary gift until it broke months later!!! The machine entered into some sort of descaling mode! I have gone through the manual and descaled the machine, I have spent the money on the descaling chemical and still the machine won\\'t work! The Nespresso website is no help and now I no longer have my favorite thing about the morning!! I have spent hundreds of dollars on capsules so for this to happen after 10 months of use I am furious! Terrible issue to have especially since it was working fine! But some sensor shuts it down!!Love it. Very easy to use.Bought in August 2019, started leaking like crazy in May 2020. Good coffee for 9 months, then it broke down and is useless. Why is this junk so expensive when it can\\'t even last 1 year? I only make 1 or 2 portions of coffee daily. It\\'s not like its running constantly. Angry and disappointed.I loved my first Virtuo machine and used it for 3 years. I purchased my second a year ago. It leaked after about 8 months. I bought another one - the third - and it lasted four months. I LOVE what the machine, but am disappointed about what seems to be declining quality. I\\'m not sure if I will purchase another.My daughter LOVES this gift I got her.Love this machine. Great price and high quality.Worked for a few weeks. All of a sudden doesn’t work Very disappointedLove, love, love my machineI’m really disappointed with Nespresso. I’m just returning the machine to Amazon because I used some times and it’s not to working anymore. It’s a second time that I bought this machine. First time I had to put on the trash because the machine has been worked for a just 3 months and stopped to work. By right now I did the return because I bought it like 30 days ago and the machine stopped to work again. I’II not to buy this machine anymore on my whole life.I got two different coffees which were delicious 😋. Then this used machine decided to quit on its own! I tried reloading three new pods. And following all instructions also emailed to me by the Seller. No luck whatsoever, the machine just refused to come on, and start to brew my next cup of coffee. But hey, these are the risks when one buys used. Returning item Tuesday or Wednesday per Amazon’s approval, thank goodness!I really like this machineIt\\'s amazing! I live with room mates from Italy and they love it too. Easy to use, once you read up on it. Otherwise, it\\'s perfect.An improvement over the Nespresso original line. The amount of crema produced is excellent!After 3 weeks of use the machine started doing this.... coffee spills everywhere. I’ve been a Nespresso machine user for over 10 years (started in Spain) and never have this happened to me. I was so excited to switch to vertuo capsules, but this machine is a big disappointment. I hope customer service responds for the productIt’s perfect, the only bad issue is about to find the Pods in stores, it’s very difficult at less in PublixWill hate this company forever now that they\\'ve discontinued the alto size in a move of greed. Apparently they plan to bring it back for their next line of machines. Absolutely disgusting business practice-- please buy yourself something else.Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.I purchased this on Oct 2019 and it stopped working on March 2021. I troubleshoot according to their manual and kept getting steady red light. I finally called Nespresso and troubleshoot with their support. The lady told me at the end, it is defective and I either get repair for $175 or purchase a new one for $175. It didn\\'t make any sense to purchase a new one since I don\\'t trust the machine anymore. I will get something reliable.Simplistic, efficient, and delicious.Design could have been better. Lid to the water container is difficult to remove. Coffee cup doesn’t sit well on its base. Otherwise unit works well and makes great coffeeLove it!Very easy to use. Coffee tastes great. No leakage from water container so far.I love the coffee. However even with the large capsules. It won\\'t make a full 7oz cup of coffee.\\nAnd the pods can not be bought everywhere.Great joe hosifate thats good coffeeThis is a very nice sleek design, nice size for your countertop. Good hot brew with little time.\\nWould recommend this.Easily brews the best cup of coffee and espresso at home. We love our new machine!What a disappointment this product has been. The directions are useless—inadequate and confusing by including directions for three different models. We have tried several times and can not make a full cup of coffee. Also, the system of different sized cups is unclear. Irritated that Amazon recommended the incorrect size of cups with this product as well. Cheap construction and I am going to toss it and take my losses. Terrible product.I love the ease and taste of making a Nespresso every day.Play Video\\n it totally destroyed inside only looks good .the worst thing evereasy to use, excellent coffee/espresso I love itEasy to use....it’ll get a work out over ThanksgivingBold coffee. Love the frother.Great strong coffee or espresso awesome machineI love this machine. It\\'s easy to use and the coffee is wonderful! I reuse the pods with my own coffee.Well, let\\'s just say this was an EPIC failure of a holiday gift for the hubby. It turned on, we started running the suggested cleaning cycle and then it stopped working. And by stop working, I mean it left the lid open, water inside the machine, and NEVER did anything else. I contacted Nespresso\\'s customer service and was advised to send it back to Amazon as it was a \"defective machine.\" I have no confidence in this brand of coffee maker...you would think that for over a hundred and fifty dollars for a coffee maker, it would make coffee. Not in this case. On the up side, Amazon refunded my money and took the BIG hunk of junk back. Save for yourself hassle and frustration--DO NOT BUY ;)Really good coffee. Super easy to use.This is the best espresso coffee machine. Faster than other and the quality is super star !!This coffee machine has given me so many problems. The pods don\\'t fall back into recycle container like they should. today only after three months the power wouldn\\'t come on and when it did, it kept brewing and over spilled all over the floor. The flavors are ok if you like weak coffee. I am told because I purchased on Amazon after 30 days I cannot return. Now I am stuck with a $200 machine that doesn\\'t work. Don\\'t buy this.I’m so thrilled with this purchase!Very happy with the machine. Would like to see more flavors of coffee available and for purchase at retail stores.Arrived with a broken part. Amazon said that the manufacturer is responsible for replacing broken or missing parts. Conatcted the manufacturer and they refused to replace it. Now I will return it and will not replace it. Unhappy with Nespresso.It hasn’t been a year & already leaking, calling customer service now.\\n\\nupdate: luckily I was still within warranty & issue was fixed, they replaced defective parts etc...The coffee maker makes great coffee due to the precision amount of water needed for a perfect balance between coffee and waterGreat machine and brews great coffee! I bought this one for my mom and she loves it!Best coffee maker everMakes a great cup of Joe!Very elegant. It makes your coffee just perfect. Expresso or regular coffee is just to good. Just press a botton and enjoy.Just got it yesterday and the price dropped $15. Really like it but have not heard from DeLonghi about a credit. Will raise the rating if we get a positive response from them! Happy New Year!Bought this for my Mother in Law because I love my Nespresso so much!\\nUnfortunately, we got it as a Christmas gift, and just went to set the machine up for her this week (she wanted to finish her Keurig cups first).\\nThe machine came out of the box broken.\\nMade all of the sounds as if it was going to brew, but wouldn’t. I tried all of the troubleshooting and had no luck.\\nI recommend buying from Nespresso directly\\n!The machine was great at first, but two months in, and it\\'s constantly overheating and stuck in descaling mode. I haven\\'t had a decent cup of coffee in weeks, so I\\'m back to going to Starbucks every few days. The only help customer service is offering is to send them my machine for up to 2 weeks, not including transit time. Since I have absolutely no intention of going 2-3 weeks without coffee, I will be buying a Keurig. The coffee\\'s not as rich but I never had any issues with my Keurig machine.A year later and having trouble making coffee. Should not have problems so quickly.The milk frother included in the package is not worth the extra money. Virtuo coffee has a natural “foam” on top making it light and frothy.Bought full price in March, broke by July. The machine started leaking coffee out of the bottom. It is not even in daily use and was broke within weeks. After contacting Nespresso for repair, it took a full week to get the padded repair box from to send it in for warranty covered repair and then another two weeks for it to come back, only to have the same problem happen again several weeks later. Once again i am having to mail in this clearly defective product, rather then getting a replacement. I’m only getting it repaired at this point to use up the pods we have left and then will likely find another more reliable product.Great coffee machineExcelente maquina, lo mejorWhy go to Starbucks when you could have better at home. It costs $1.10 a cup. 14.5 oz cup.Awesome! Love it. Way better than older models I’ve owned. Especially better with heating up.I\\'m growing weary of Amazon\\'s quickly declining quality. I hope the company will begin to look into quality again soon. Before last year I never had to return or request a refund, but in the past year almost 1/2 of what I purchase breaks.\\nI purchased this for myself as I am used to Amazon\\'s poor quality now, and didn\\'t want to risk a gift breaking. That being said, I purchased the same item as a gift for my son from Williams Sonoma at the same time, so he could avoid the Amazon quality issues. And here I am returning my broken machine from Amazon and his from Williams Sonoma is fine. So annoying!Positives: Machine very well built and runs perfectly with great foam, perfect temp and easy to use,\\nNegatives: Very limited coffee options, no other suppliers, the available coffee is so so and quite expensive.Speedy and delicious coffee. Sturdy machine.The best coffee you can drink and eases you can make.I love it.Worth every penny.my 3rd Nespresso Machine, always breaks never last long. Dont buy.When I first bought my Nespresso the coffee if made was better than Starbucks. After several months (using only 2x\\'s daily) I noticed the amount of coffee it made got smaller and the machine started leaking. Now, 3 months after my purchase there is more coffee that leaks from the machine than ends up in my cup. And the \\'return\\' window has closed. I am very disappointed in my puchase and would not recommend this product to anyone. EXTREMELY UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER.I loveee my machine sooo much! So far is amazing! Great price and suchhh good coffee!Worked for about a year. Then it died! A total waste of money. Our previous Nespresso machine lasted a long time. This one is junk!WOW OMG Great espresso, easy to use, no words to describe.This product is complete waste of time. So dissapointed. First day recieved it. All good. Up to expectations but taste wasn\\'t so flavorful as expected. Made 2 cups successfully. Next morning excited to make more. Nope! Broken already. Other reviews stated an issue with Descaling mode needed. Made 2 cups and already needs descaling!? What makes it worse even is ran descaling and still can\\'t clear it! And it can\\'t make coffee anymore. Complete garbage. Don\\'t even waste your time with this product. Now I need to pack up everything, drive to UPS. waste gas and time.Love the coffeeNespresso customer service is great if you have issues. Make sure you register your product. Great Coffee and espresso flavorsGood product for coffee lovers.this unit occasionally leaks - the older model never leakedBest coffee maker ever....my husband refuses to use the old machine ever again.Not the item I thought it was.The best coffee ever, It make me I want to get up in the morningI gave this to my daughter-in-law and she loves it and opened it and used it immediately!The first month with the Nespresso Vertuo Plus was flawless, but now that it\\'s been two months, I can only use the coffee maker about 50% of the time.\\n\\nI keep it plugged in all day, and some days when I try to use it, the device has a solid green light but when I push the brew button; nothing happens, and I\\'ll wait three minutes.\\n\\nI need to return this device, it\\'s super disappointing for such a \"premium\" promiseIt’s okLove the flavor of the coffeesIt was convenient while it worked , but after 20 months of use machine got stuck whole opening and was inoperable . Steady red light on and unable to do any reset .\\nI will not be getting another one , just not worth my money.Very nice set up very good coffee. Just make sure you get the pod like coffee not capsules that is for a different machine.We’re Nespresso FansAwesome product. Awesome product web site. If you can afford Starbucks then this for you.Terrible ease of use from the beginning. I thought maybe it was because I never had an espresso maker but after a few weeks I realized it must have been either broken during delivery or just broken before I received it never really worked it took several times to get the coffee to come out even warm if it came out at all. Extremely disappointed I saved up to get me this machine and I never got it to work but a handful of times.Best coffee ever! Easy to use machine - love it!I love this coffee machine. I use it everyday. It\\'s easy to use and looks very modern.Love it and enjoy it. Don\\'t get coffee when i am out anymore.It is so Compact and perfect I love the coffeeI have wanted a Nespresso for quite a while and this one is perfect! I love the that the milk steamer is a completely separate unit.It is never easy to use these machines; especially cleaning processes and deciding the volume of coffee needs to be brewed. Need to return and look for something else.Nespresso has the best tasting coffee, I have barely bought coffee out since my purchase. Highly reccomend!I purchased this for a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it!My husband is going to love it. He loves coffee so this will make him very happy.Love the machine but frother does not get as hot as I would like but no issues.Product is perfect and does exactly what I wanted it to doMachine was delivered in a damaged box with\\nExpired capsules by more than a year.\\nHaven’t used it obviously since I have to order capsules now.The most simple and quick pit-together ever. Done in five minutes and enjoyed the delicious coffee brew immediatelyThis is a well liked gift.LOVE THIS COFFEE!!!!!!!!!!Bit slow but overall great!Love this machine. Had some issues with it and Nespresso\\'s customer service is so awesome that they replaced it and sent out a new one over nightThe machine was great at the beginning. We use it every morning and everything seems to be fine. After roughly one month, I noticed there are some water under the machine and today, after almost two month of usage, there are more water on my table. I do not know it is just me or others but this is really annoyingWe used it at Mom\\'s assisted living apartment. Absolutely perfect. Simple, Clean, One Button.Broke in a week. Ordered a Vertu (not plus) and it’s been awesome. Keep in mind coffee is very strong, so be prepared.Works great every-timereceived package on time and love it! Makes amazing coffee really fast!This is the second broken unit I received through Amazon. The first one arrived with a broken clasp. I sent it back and received this unit. The water flow mechanism is broken, so the water never leaves the tank. I spent about an hour on the phone with nespresso.com, going through the same troubleshooting steps I did on my own, and it still wouldn\\'t work. I thought, really?? It\\'s not like I\\'m designing a nuclear warhead. All this trouble for an overpriced cup of coffee. Amazon was generous. They offered to send me a third one, but I gave up and asked for my money back.100It makes awesome coffeeThe packaging was ripped and it was taped up. The water container had water spots on it already! The machine makes inconsistent amounts of coffee that doesn’t align with the amount in ounces that the pod lists. Be careful with this provider.I really wanted to love this but the coffee just dispenses to cold. the company needs to install some sort of temperature adjustment within the unit. Its such a shame because the quality of coffee is great but the coffee never comes out hotter than lukewarm.Awesome product !!Wonderful coffee. I am just sad that the pods are so expensive!I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She loves it and uses it every day.The besttttt coffee maker!!!!! Love itFast and easyexcellent productI gave this to my son as a gift and he loves it!I wanted to contact the seller or whoever shipped this product. I was very disappointed on how it arrived. It had a huge hole in it. This is an expensive product to not have it protected during shipping.This machine stopped working in less than a year. And when it was working, I was not impressed with the quality of the coffee it was making: too much foam and not a lot of flavor. I believe their \"original\" espresso machine is better made/designed and makes better coffee/espresso thank the vertuo line.not working after 6 months called manufacture on hold forever will not stand by there product very rude DON\\'T BUYI was VERY unhappy with this product! I ordered what I thought was a brand machine! The coffee machine I received was clearly used!! The milk frothier had what looked to be spoiled milk inside of it. It also had an awful odor coming from the whole box. You could tell the box was not brand new either! I sent it back right away!Best cup of coffee ever! Very pleased with this and the amazing Amazon service that came with it!Throw your Keurig in the garbage!\\nThis is the best tasting coffee I’ve ever had!Love this coffee machine. Don\\'t try to force it open has to be plugged in order for you to put the pods in it.Very happy with this purchase coffee is delicious. Just wish had purchased sooner!Just purchased and installed so still figuring it out but used twice now and the coffee dispensed both times was delicious! Looking forward to more.Love it!The best espresso for the price!!!! a lot of crema We love itNo problems so farAfter less than a year, my VertuoPlus began leaking coffee from the bottom of the appliance. This has been regularly maintained by cleaning and descaling. I called Nespresso Club and after learning about the problem, they offered a replacement...of a cheaper version because they said mine was out of stock. I declined and told them I’m going through the Asurion plan I purchased, and so far I’m glad I did. Do yourself a favor and don’t buy this, or if you do, make sure you purchase the Asurion plan because Nespresso Club were useless with their assistance and I wouldn’t be getting another if it weren’t for the plan.This thing is crap! Bought it as an anniversary present in August and crapped out on us after 4 months! Never buying this brand ever again. Should\\'ve gotten a keurig from the get go. Dont be fooled by the “pay more, you’ll get a quality brand” mentality. Cheap plastic and expensive pods.. etc etc!!It\\'s very nice vertuo machine.\\nIt is compatible with Nespresso vertuo coffee capsule. And I enjoy it everyday.This is easy and quick to use, nothing to clean up.I love this machine, It make the best espresso and cappuccino , ECTGreat coffee machineLove the coffee machine and coffee, but wish it produced a little bit hotter cup. So far no leaks!Inconsistent. Went through 4-5 espresso pods with only a few drops of coffee and the rest was water. Thought I had a bad batch of pods and bought more. No luck. 24 pods and only 6 worked. However, the 6 that worked were delicious. Moving on to Breville espresso machine.The coffee maker never worked!!! It would only clean!! Never got a cup of coffee!! Sadly had to return it ! I got the original Nespresso which was Amazon choice!! Always listen to Amazon!! 😁Worth every penniesIt is a terrific coffee and espresso machine. Love it!This is a fantastic machine and makes excellent espresso!Very easy to use. It is perfect machine for my coffee.Great item. Don’t know why people’s machines are leaking. I have no problems.Product already broken after 1 month. Automatic opens no shut feature doesn’t work anymore and gets stuck.I think this a coffee maker that you need a in your lifeCame brand new but when I tried to use it the very first time it had a solid red light. I looked in the manual what this means and it means the machine is not running. So I went to Nespresso website and diagnosed the problem and followed their instructions on how to fix it. It let me make coffee the one time after that. But every morning I had that issue. I returned it after that. It’s been 2 weeks since Amazon has received my defective item. Yet still have not received my refund.....The first one I received wouldn\\'t shut off and would spill all over the counter. I returned it and requested a replacement. The replacement wouldn\\'t even run water so I returned it as well. It was supposed to be a birthday gift for my girlfriend so I bought one locally that worked but was more expensive. Now Amazon is shorting my refund by 40 dollars.I never knew you could make such quality coffee at Home! Muuuucch better than a keurig!Make an amazing shot of espresso. The crema is Rich and creamy.Me encantoFirst coffeemaker and totally in love with itLove this machineWe love our Nespresso. Easy to order pods on lineWife loves it. Uses it everyday. Haven\\'t cleaned it yet so can\\'t comment.Great product! Used from the moment recieved.Great coffee machine with good range of samples for an amazing priceGreat productLovely. Great taste, easy to use. Nespresso has fabulous service. Starbuck\\'s watch out. Wish the price of the capsules were less. :(Great amazon deal. We use daily. Easy to use and no mess.Love itgood descriptionMakes great coffee and easy to use. Better than Starbucks for sure.Amazing and easy to use! Makes a perfect cup of coffee!Such a cool design! The coffee tastes great!I love my nespresso. Will never go to regular coffee againWe loved our Nespresso for 9 mos while it worked. and have since attempted to reset the machine several times. We contact Amazon and they are impossible to reach... we contact Nespresso and they won\\'t accept my customer services email, then spoke with a rep and he suggested contacting Amazon. What a joke! Horrible customer service a and extremely disappointed in this machine. Again, great when it works....I order this Nespresso on the 13 of Dec. 2020 and I received it just after Xmas. Well I didn\\'t use it not even 2 months and the machine stop working. End January 2021 the machine stop working. I am soooo upset and disappointed. Waste of my money now sitting with a brand new machine that I have no used for . Unbelievable. Pls don\\'t buy thisEverything I expectedWe love our Nespresso!Such a waste. They hook you with a cheap machine because you’re dependent on the pods. Much the same with buying ink cartridges. I never ever see the pods on sale, especially around Cyber Monday I thought they would have one. But I’ve moved on and now bought a regular coffee maker.Great Nespresso machineOur nespresso vertuo was great in the beginning , however after about 6months it completely stopped working , we wasted more coffee pods trying to get it to work ..for what we paid for it it seems like it should have worked longer ,so disappointedBest coffee you\\'ll EVER have. Hard to find capsules still.Got it during discount. Worth the price. Easy to use.Best coffee.WE LOVE IT!head and shoulder above Keurig.. smart yet simple.. makes regular coffee or espresso automatically by size of pod\\nfoamed coffee looks and tastes deliciousHandy\\nEfficient\\nGreat frothy coffeeI’m giving a one star rating not because I don’t like this item but because this was supposed to be a gift and this was the condition of the box when I received it. The box was torn and taped up and there were multiple return labels on it which made me question whether the Nespresso machine was used or not working right and returned. I’m very disappointed and wanted to return it for a new one. I tried contacting the seller thru Amazon but I never heard back from them.Makes great coffee BUT you must place the water container on the pedestal in exactly the correct position or it leaks like crazy. Not happy about that!I love my vertoluneThis was the best machine until it stopped working after only 3 months. The machine will turn on, however, will no longer brew when you press the brew button. Utterly disappointed considering how expensive this is. Do NOT recommend wasting your money.👍🏻👍🏻Easy to use. Directions are clear and simple. Worth the investment.Afternoon Expresso coffeeSuch a deal on black friday! Great taste to the pods and the wife is crazy about it.Cheaply made product, spring activated and once the spring broke it was virtually a useless product.\\nWill not purchase from this manufacturer again.No idea why a product would arrive used. Returned.Works great and makes a terrific cup of coffee. No cleanup.This is a nice coffee machine, however, it leaks like crazy. My counter is always soaked. I would not recommend this product at all.Great machine, and makes fantastic coffee. Just be aware that there are no after-market coffee pods available for this.Best coffee maker I\\'ve ever had, hands down.Awesome machine. 3rd one our family has bought..always a treat.I loved the nespresso. It is the best cup of coffee I have ever made at home.As advertised, quality taste and consistent on all levels.the capsules are a little pricey... but overall a good buyfantastic quality. Much better than regular Nespresso machinesWow ..... great coffee .. .with a foam on top ... like the coffee places !!! love itEven though coffee was excellent, machine began to leak second day in. Just like many reviewers mentioned before, luckily Nesspresso is taking care of replacement but still disappointing, its not cheap.My husband LOVES everything about this coffee maker....so much so hr broke up with Starbucks.I love the coffee! Easy to set up and use. I wish the pods were less expensiveWorks great. I have had ZERO issues with leaking on this machine! Would recommend!Lid for Aeroccino Milk Frother arrived in this shape.The maker worked great from the beginning. after about 30 days it leaks all over my counter on each use. Im not sure if its the design or a defect. Will Amazon stand behind this product???I am even more addicted to coffee. A lot better than the kerugOpen, close, one button and no mess to clean upLove it. Works great right out of the box. Latte a lot!It changed my coffee taste foreverIt came damagedThe spinning technology creates beautiful foam and makes coffee less bitter and taste more rounded. Love this machine.Perfect to make a coffee at homeLove this coffee maker. Nespresso is the best ever.The PERFECT cup of coffee or espresso!Love it - costs more but does a great job and coffee is better than K cup brandsmachine works greatOur new Nespresso is a fine addition to our kitchen.Love it!This product makes a fine cup of coffee/espresso. Grand, even. Unfortunately for me the needle broke just outside of the 1 year warranty. $125 to whisk away the machine for repair or a 35% discount on a replacement machine (mind you, this discount isn\\'t applicable to the latest machine) for about the same amount. Already an indulgent approach to morning coffee, this is an untenable luxury in the post COVID-19 hellscape we find ourselves. Don\\'t add more uncertainty to your life. It\\'s on to chicory for me. Lukewarm regards, Nespresso.Brews a coffee house style of coffeeSimple but fantastic. Tastes freshly brewedIt’s easy to use, great tasting with several options.It’s easy to operate and the coffee is delicious.I was worried about having it sent to me. But it camenon time and was perfectBox looked suspiciously like it had been opened, but everything inside seemed to be packaged properly. The milk frother is fine, but the coffee machine has never worked- it won’t pull water from the tank. I even looked online and saw this is a common issue, and tried all the troubleshooting techniques to no avail. Very unhappy.We’ll for sure i can make work properly so\\nI end up doing a return not happy withDo not buy!!!! This machine is 3 days old. I have water leaking all over my kitchen counter. First time plugging it in, I was impressed by being able to brew a full cup of coffee and I also have a (pixie). My excitement washed away quickly because the machine started leaking everywhere. I thought that was odd. I cleaned up the mess but the machine continues to leak every time I use it. I will be calling amazon and Nespresso today. This review will be updated after I find out if my machine will be replaced or fixed.I love all of it. Takes little counterspace and is quiet. Makes excellent coffee and espresso.I\\'m very happy with this systemSimple to use and great quality coffeeLove it!!!!Just a big no on this thing. A Keurig just makes coffee, just works. A Keurig doesn\\'t lock you into a single source for coffee. A Keurig won\\'t lock up in an attempt to sell \"descaling\" packets. A Keurig doesn\\'t cost as much as airfare home for the holidays\\n\\nTo be fair, this thing continues to work. It\\'s not \"broken\" per se. But the next time it locks up _forcing_ me to descale it I\\'m likely to beat it to death with a baseball bat. Never again Nespresso. You lost a lifetime customer over a five dollar descaling packet. CongratsThe Nespresso Vertuo Plus Deluxe machine is a waist of money. Difficult to use. Coffee is not hot.\\nVertuo pods are difficult to find and very expensive.\\nCustomer service is non-responsive.Love love loveeeeee this machine!!!I was impressed with the coffee that it makes but the resivoir tank is not secure enough to stop from leaking...Great deal, hot coffee quickly, great flavor varietyGift for my sister who loved this productThe red is beautiful. The coffee is delicious.We originally got the breville Nespresso and saw the Delonghi brand for cheaper. Like many other reviews, it does have flaws. It goes through a cleaning system at set up and was not working correctly. When finally getting it all set up, it also brewed differently than the Breville. The pump doesn’t seem to be powerful enough for the machine . We are returning it.If you like coffee you\\'ll love this unitGreat product & coffee! Better then Starbucks!Will not take in water which makes it useless.I’m a Nespresso fan and have 2 machines for the original line capsule. I originally bought the Cube when Nespresso first came on the scene and later a pixie for my office. I bought this machine hoping for a quality coffee product like the original line. This coffee is a Cadillac Keurig and the coffee does not taste good. I would return but have missed my window to return. Too bad. If you love Nespresso original line and love the quality, rich coffee, stick with it.Yes to all uses!!!this was an affordable gift looks greatDo not buy. Get the Evoluo model. After two and a half months this machine started pouring coffee out the back of the machine during brewing. It got all into the used capsule storage area and all over my counter with each brew. After two phone calls to the Nespresso club, and three hours of my time, they sent a replacement Evoluo machine. Apparantely they do not fix this model....probably because there are so many leaky models that its an inherent design flaw. Google it....you will see the number of complaints.Had to have it replaced due to stopped working in less then a week.Everything as advertised. It’s a dream come true for people on the Go.Great coffee, love the flavors but the thing leaks coffee every time. The pods and service have been great but this specific machine leaves a puddle of coffee behind. Not sure what causes it.When it works it is very easy to use. However, my machine stopped working after 2 months of use. Sent my machine for repair, but when returned it continued to not work. Would not recommend this product.Coffee okay. Machine started leaking even though used infrequentlyCouldn\\'t have gotten a better coffee machineRead the one star reviews. Same exact thing happened to us. Stopped working after a year. Very disappointedworked fine for 2 months but now unusable as it leaks 1/4 cup of coffee water from the head of the machine where the capsule goesThe cleaning cycle doesn’t workReturned two of these VertuoPlus models: first one, the motor broke on the lid lifter, and the second one, the water carafe leaked. Nespresso is good about customer service to exchange for a new one, but after two problems with this newest model, I asked them to send me last years model, the Evoluo. In retrospect, I should have assumed a motorized lid was unnecessary and with more moving parts would be prone to failure over time (but not two weeks, for Pete\\'s sake), and the very slim water-feed mechanism, which the Nespresso agent acknowledged was giving them fits, was too pretty/cool, yet problematic.The coffee was great but broke after a few months of use. Nespresso wants me to send it out to them to get it fixed leaving me without a machine for likely a month. Just going to buy a new machine of a different brand most likely.I look forward to using this every morning, definitely better than my bodega coffeeI love it. Use every day.The best coffee ever!!It takes too long and sometimes it doesnt work. Not functioning wellVery easy to use, makes good coffeeI already have 1 and the machine itself is great. However, this was a gift and the packaging was broken, falling apart and completely unacceptable. Not sure I will be ordering again from here in the future.This product does not use classic Nespresso pods, only Vertuo. There were no Vertuo pods at 2 Kroger locations and one pack available at 2 Safeway locations. Have to buy them online.Honestly everything and more!Would give no stars if I could, Got a used machine, this is not acceptable when you pay for the new one, do not order from Amazon, get one directly from Nespresso!Makes coffee as good as any I\\'ve had anywhere. Quick and easy too.DO NOT BUY THIS!! Purchased a ‘new’ Nespresso machine at full price and it came used, without instructions, without the manufacturers box, without the free nespresso pods, and didn’t even work. Coffee stains on the bottom of the machine from the person before. Extremely dissatisfied & will be returning immediately.Makes a great cup of espresso.My wife loves it! Best coffee from home that she’s ever had.The product produces coffee, but you continue to pay for specially packaged coffee.\\nThe eventual total cost of ownership will be very high. The product is very over-engineered.\\nI prefer the ability to buy my own espresso coffee any time and using an inexpensive machine to produce drinkable coffee.That it\\'s not compatible with small capsules.I purchased this at Christmas and it’s already breaking down. It freezes up constantly so I have to reset it. It now also will only males shots and not full size cups like it did before. Unhappy I spent nearly $200 on a machine that didn’t last but a few months.Dangerously addicting. In a good way!!Love, love, love the rich coffee at home. Wish recycling were easier.Love it! Best coffee ever. Super fast and delicious!The machine started to leak coffee within a month of my purchase. I sent it to repair.how can I machine that has been only used for a month can break down? It’s ridiculous.This machine makes wonderful coffee...at least it did before it started leaking all over my counter. It has been descaled with no effect. I bought it in April of this year and it started leaking a month ago. That is only 6 months of use for a very expensive coffee maker. I went back and read reviews about this model on the Nespresso website. Everyone complains of it leaking. As much money as the coffee is you would think they could make a quality product.Great product the coffee maker is excellentI like itoh my goodness, it’s perfect!!!I bought it a year and a half ago. It now only makes clear water when the pod is inserted. Have followed all descaling protocols. Manual and online show no info on how to fix the situation. Not sure the money and expensive pods are worth it for a coffee pot that only lasts a year and a half. Don’t recommend.When it makes the correct cup, it is great coffee. When...the 7.77 oz cups always deliver over 15 oz of watered-down coffee and over half the 2.4 oz pods/double espresso pods deliver over 6 oz of watered-down \\'espresso.\\' Wouldn\\'t recommend at any price. You have to order pods and well over half don\\'t work. Avoid!!It isn\\'t the foam, it is the coffee itself that brars no resemblence to real coffee. I am the total cofee dnob, down to roasting my own beans. This is easy to you but prople who love real coffee will be disappointed.Love the coffee but the machine doesn\\'t last... one lbroke after just a few pods...three orders... they replaced....then the second one lasted just long enough to be out of warranty...2 pods a day is not stressing the machine...my question to nespresso after three machines and hundreds of pods...why cannot they back the machine up just fix the machines.....I HAVE TWO SITTING HERE DOING THE SAME LEAKING EACH TIME I DO A POD...WORTHLESS ...AND BOTH PURCHASED IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS...So sad to find that this item was defective.Such good coffee.Amazing. Love itThe first one I purchased started leaking after three months. The Amazon replaced it with a new one, after I used the second one for 3 1/2 months, It started leaking again. I tried to call the support line, it transferred me to Nespresso, then let me wait for over 20 minutes, nobody picked up my call. Unfortunately, I purchased hundreds of its coffee capsules. Hopefully, Nespresso can replace it with a different model without this leaking problem.Great product .Broke in less than 60 days. Took immaculate care of it; cleaned it on a weekly basis. Warranty process is a pain in the assets; attempted to have us repair it ourselves (I definitely do not fall into the “handy man” cohort) then tried to replace it w/ a cheaper model until I finally said I was putting all this on amazon and magically my model was available for replacement. Absolutely ridiculous. Is it really that hard to do the right thing?By Nespresso. Works perfectlyLove this productPods are expensive, but saved money cause wife stopped going to Starbucks.So awesome. Virtue coffee is the best.Need to find affordable pods!!!!!!!!!!!!Love my Nespresso!Good, but hardly any reusable pieces. Should have stayed universal to keurig style podsAfter less than 1 month of usage the machine has broken. Now no matter what mode I turn it to, all it does is spout out boiling hot water from the steamer (see pictures). Not only does it no longer brew coffee but it’s also hazardous.Great coffee and slim in sizeSo after waiting almost two weeks and it not being her for Christmas this is how it came! Obviously was a return since the seals were gone! Extremely damaged becasue it was not in a box! I am very disappointed becasue this was supposed to be a gift!We absolutely loved the machine but it just randomly stopped working. We\\'ve been unable to reach anyone about a repair.I ordered this product in December, did not start using the machine until end of January. The machine completely stopped working after 5 months of use. This was past the amazon return date, and now I am stuck with an expensive coffee machine that needs to be sent in to the manufacturer every 5 months for \"service\" repairs. Horrible purchase, I don\\'t recommend for anyone who likes to drink their coffee every day.Love this machine!This machine was really hard to use from day one because behaved inconsistently. You have to remember an arcane sequence of pulling a lever and pressing a button in order to reset it. Did not accurately sense pod size. Stopped working after two weeks. Service rep was clueless and gave faulty instructions.The product I received is dirty and smells like coffee. There are specks of coffee grounds where the pod goes and the pods are literally open. Really disappointed.Love the red color of the Nespresso Vertuo Plus...probably more than that the...the Vertuo Plus is made in the Ukraine.\\nI have purchased three Vertuo Plus machines, one for the office, and two for home. The red Vertuo Plus is an awesome color and meets every expectation I have. The Keurig coffee machines cannot stand up to a hard comparison...boils down to Keurig\\'s plastic tasting K-cup coffee vs the Nespresso aluminum capsules top coffee quality and incredible taste.\\nI\\'d buy another Nespresso Vertuo Plus just because it is made in the Ukraine...but I\\'ve run out of kitchen counter space...!!!Gift for husband and he lovesMy family loved this giftMakes a great strong cup of coffee and espresso.Best espresso machine out there!Love how easy it is to useGreat product! Absolutely love it!I love itWorked good until it broke. Get the breville instead.Loved, loved, loved it!DeliciousDespite following all directions for descaling and cleaning, the common problem has no emerged on my machine. While it technically does still brew Nespresso, instead of depositing it in my cup from the spout on the front and prefers to blast it out of the back resulting in a messy counter. Currently waiting on Nespresso to contact me back re:warranty.Estoy muy desepcionada y preocupada que mi maquina esta liqueando cafe, tanto dinero que bale para que me aiga salido asi.😡Love this productNot for sure I would purchase this through Amazon again. Compared to my daughter in law’s, my frothed does not hear up like hers does and the automatic pod disposal sticks sometimes. Very disappointed after only a month’s use.First one did not function properly. Returned for an exchange. Second one didn’t make coffee hot enough. Only 155. Got shorted about $13.00+- on my refund, I assume they charged me for return shipping. Bad deal, bad business practice.There wasn’t any capsules in box as describedLove at first sightWorth every pennyPerfectaExcellent itemCoffee perfection ! My family loves it!Love the machine. Great way to start one\\'s daysDon\\'t buy this coffee machine. This would have been my 4th Nespresso machine. All the other machines were great. After less than 2 months this one starts leaking coffee bad inside the machine. I wish I had taken the time to read the product reviews for it before I purchased it. You will end up with coffee all over the inside of the machine and leaking out underneath it.This was a gift and they loved it!Quality Coffee and it works great!Best espresso machine everMy machine gave the overheating red light after using for a month. Nespresso recommended returning the machine but the seller is not accepting refunds. Do not buy from this seller!Our DeLonghi Nespresso maker starting leaking after only three months of limited use. Tried descaling twice even though probably not needed. Still leaks and makes huge mess. Waiting to hear from Delonghi as due to time past Amazon cannot help. Very disappointed.\\n\\nAfter 45 minutes on phone with DeLonghi have to now send coffee maker back for service. Will not buy DeLonghi products again. BEWARE. This coffee maker is cheaply made.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! I bought it as a Christmas gift for girlfriend. Worked fine for around a month then randomly stopped brewing anything. Sometimes won’t even power on, tried reset and rescaling. Still nothing. I am livid. Don’t waste your moneyDon\\'t buy! This machine is terrible!!!! If you can get it make a cup it\\'s good but it can waste a bunch of pods to get that cup. Throwing this machine in the trash!!!Not anywhere close to what was advertised\\nLooked very cheap and the water tank was just big enough for 2 full cups of coffee.\\nI owned one in the past and this one felt and looked very cheap!!Great ptoductI bought two of these. The first leaked water underneath after 6 months, the second leaked thick dark coffee which was a great breeding ground for fruit flies, hence the photo attached. Bought a Breville version for Nespresso, hopefully the different design doesn’t leak anything. Sorry if the photo is the wrong orientation, that’s how Amazon upload showed it...🥰Don’t buy from here.\\nJust buy from nespresso.\\nThis machine doesn’t work at all.\\nBought it and it will not work what so ever.\\nUseless. I’m very disappointed as I was so excited. Returning and going back to keurig.We love itI ordered a Nespresso vertuo plus and it broke down within the month . I got a replacement witch took a bit to get to me and I’ve had so may issue with it , now I’m stuck with a defective unit.I love this machine!always excellent qualityLeaked from the moment it arrived. The water tank never seemed to seal correctly. Did not use it and returned it. I ended up buying a Vertuo Next and am very happy with it.such good flavor works greatSimple joyVery good coffeeGreat coffee!drink everyday.I tried to give this product a five star review but two have died immediately. The first we could return because it was a week. The second unit died 7 days after the return, leaving us with a very expensive piece of trash. So incredibly disappointed and frustrated. If you are going to send a used unit it has to work! Will never buy this brand again. Just absolutely trash.I love the compact size and the coffee is delightful!Very very good.How did I live without this?Love it!!Nespresso is awesome and they keep getting better, but they still use a proprietary technology to restrict the consumer and force them into buying Nespresso product only. I can’t afford that and I can’t support an anti-consumer mentality. I have a family and I don\\'t have the funds to continue buying Nespresso pods. They need to open up to other companies to make alternative cups, like Keurig.Best coffee ever!I love this , it’s perfect. Easy to use , not messy ! I love that it has a built in trash can and I love that you get sooooo many pods! The only thing that sucks is that you have to keep the information sheet of the pods or you won’t know what they are! It would be nice if it was written on them or just a surprise every time . For me I like to put them all in a big container but you would have to keep the other information sheet / box to know what you are getting.Product as described, received just in time for gift.Love itHi this coffee maker and capsules worked for 2 months and from 1st March the green light comes on capsuele is pierced and no more progress am very disappointed do i return to you for replacement or ?\\nEllenSo not purchase from this site. I supposedly purchased a brand new machine with milk frothier. The box came ripped and damaged. The machine was used and dirty and the milk frothier was missing.WOST EXPERIENCE EVER. I honestly never leave reviews, but my experience with this product was absolutely miserable. The PRODUCT came in broken and seemed used, the box was cut open exposing the machine and the process of returning this product has been an absolute nightmare !Amazing coffee!Love it. Creamy foamy coffee\\nExcellent machine so farGood product.Wedding gift, as asked for!Easy to use and fastLove it2 nonworking machines later and I still don\\'t have a single cup of coffee. I called Nespresso to trouble shoot and they told me to return it and get another, which AMAZON did immediately. But when the second machine also didnt work, Nespresso also telling me to return it. Im not going for a third machine. Don\\'t waste your time like I did. Will stick to Keurig.Fantastic quality, taste and selection. Love it!Worked great at first, but now I lost the great test , the great foam , and sure enough lost the return window.\\nSo now I have an expensive Coffe maker that makes worst Coffe then k.\\n\\nThanks Amazon sellerThis machine was working great with semi-regular use...until it started leaking water. Now every time there is water in the machine, there is a big puddle on my counter. Not worth the money!I love the Espresso (blue pack) better than starbucks shotWife loves itLove itNespresso by De\\'Longhi ENV150GYAE VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De\\'Longhi, 5.6 x 16.2 x 12.8 inches, Graphite Metal - Amazon sends me to talk with Asurion, then Asurion sends me to talk with Nespresso company. Then Nespresso company doesn\\'t recognize the identification number of my machine... Finally, I can send my machine to get fixed. This is a long road.Makes great coffee but leaking water after just a few daysLove itIn lovePerfect as expected! Definitely recommended.Love itAwesome !!!After only 1 month of using this, it started to have issues registering if the pod was in, the pods would get stuck when opening, and it would dispense too little or too much water for the specified pod. Definitely do not recommend this product.PerfectAfter 6 weeks, my Nespresso is leaking coffee colored fluid, not just water! Past the return window....ughAmazing :)like the ease of use and only make what i useGreatThe coffee was not hot enough and it made way too much froth. Great for espresso, but needed it mainly for coffee. Decided to return.Love itWe got two years out of ours and that is not using it regularly. I called Nespresso and they said we could either pay $125 for a repair or they\\'d give us a 35% discount on a new one. No thanks...I bought this machine in February and now it is not working. It is a piece of crap. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MACHINE! No customer support!!! No support from Amazon either! I have just thrown hundreds of dollars down the drain! DO NOT BUY!3 DAYS after the return window closed the machine started pouring coffee out of the back of the machine onto my counter and in the used pod container every time I make a coffee. I had my original Nespresso machine for YEARS and NEVER HAD A PROBLEM! This one is HORRIBLE!!! I’m pissed that I wasted money on a machine that worked 92 days!!!!!ExcellentThis machine broke after two weeks of use. It stopped dispensing the correct amount of water, the button never worked and it was problematic from the start.Great coffee every time.Went to Greece and we were ruined for ever drinking anything else but nespresso. We have been drinking keurig but feeling like we were missing something and so I ordered this for my husband for Father’s Day and he says it’s the best Father’s Day present I’ve ever given him! So far exceeds our expectations for coffee. It’s just so fresh and delicious and if you read about the science of why it’s really fascinating. Just order one and try it for yourself. You won’t go back to anything else.ExcellentI purchased this on the recommendation of my mother.....yes I still listen to my mom. Well we both got hammered...just like all their other reviews...after a bit the unit starts leaking from the back. Coffee everywhere...Tried all the \"Stuff\" to fix it...nope didn\\'t work. The design is flawed. Just dont buy..wast of $$. Especially for the price!Was so excited for this to arrive only for it not to heat or brew. The green light only turns on if i unplug it and plug it back in, and when i push the brew button at that point nothing happens. Very disappointed.This is the second time we’ve had issues with the machine operating. The top button was broken and we sent it back to the manufacturer to fix and now it’s broken again ☹️Broken after 6 months, no response from the company. Do not buySimple to use, fast coffee, great taste.Works great, brews delicious coffee. Would recommend.Amazing. Best espresso I’ve ever had.awesomeI specifically ordered this model as it indicated Delonghi model in the description and once again the wrong model was sent - I received the Nespresso model which is not the same and water container is smaller and the parts are all plastic versus the Delonghi model which has more well constructed parts and larger water reseviour.i love it. the size of the coffee was perfect!It broke before 2 months time. Lid won’t close. Now it’ll take time and effort to repair instead of just replacing it.works as is! no leaks so far!Leaked from the moment we opened it. Would leak water all over the counter from the water reservoir and also while using make a big mess.greatI love this product and would purchase again.Piece of junk. We waste 3 cartridges an still doesn\\'t work. Very unhappy. We have guests over for Good Friday and the thing has become are center of dissatisfaction.This product is no good. I’ve owned it for 4 months. It now leaks everywhere. The pods for this machine and the machine itself is very expensive. Not worth it! Complete piece of crap and Nespresso customer service also matches the product. Don’t buy this! It will disappoint you and leave you a lot lighter in the wallet.water tank LeakBrokeAwesomePurchased item as new, item I received was clearly used down to the sticky coffee residue all over the front of the unit, very gross!This machine makes great coffee, if it works. I spend more time troubleshooting and on the phone with customer service than I do actually enjoying coffee though and that’s never a good way to start your day. Don’t waste your money.This was an out of box failure. Called Nespresso and customer support was great. They determined it was an out of box failure and I could either send it to them for repair/replacement or I could send it back to Amazon. I\\'m sending it back to Amazon for a refund. Disappointed because I was looking forward to using this machine.Milk frother would spin completely off!We love our Nespresso maker!First off, and most important, this makes amazingly good coffee. I am not an fancy coffee person, I don\\'t do Starbucks or similar shops, I just like a good cup of coffee. And this definitely nails that.\\nThe pods are pretty expensive, so this is not my everyday coffee but for a treat on weekends or special occasions only. If the pods were more readily available, and definitely if they were cheaper, I\\'d probably end up drinking it more often, but I\\'ve only been able to find them online so far, and there aren\\'t any off brands yet.\\nMy biggest issue with this machine is the lack of a low water light or something similar. When it runs out of water, it doesn\\'t tell you. It will start making coffee and make only half of a pod because it ran out of the water. A few times this has happened I thought I put in an espresso pod which makes a much smaller cup. And of course once I opened up the machine and realized I put in a bigger pod, I can\\'t use it again because it\\'s poked so many holes in and the pod is pretty much wasted. Obviously I am working on remembering to check that every time before I turn it on, but that does not help my guests very much when they go to use it.\\nI also wish that the water reservoir was more firmly attached to the machine. It\\'s great that you can position it to the back or the side, but it feels like if I am not super careful when I refill it, I could break it off from the actual machine. And, of course I want a bigger reservoir.\\nOverall, I love the coffee that this machine makes enough that I will continue using it, but I hope by the time I\\'m ready for a new one they have considered the design a bit more.I like the coffeemaker but am very unhappy with the fact that it needs to be descaled (cleaned) very often. I am very dissatisfied with this and want to return it since it doesn\\'t work properly.I love itVery good product @ reasonable price.Only 7 months after purchasing this expensive coffeemaker, it began leaking. I called Amazon customer service and was told that it\\'s only covered by Amazon for 30 days, that I have to handle this with the manufacturer.\\nVery disappointing purchase and shame on Amazon for this dreadful customer service. NB, New YorkI no longer go to Starbucks... :)Leaks after expression coffee is made. Doesn\\'t happen with Nespresso machine and cups get stuck when openingProblems from the beginning. Should have returned it. Just won’t make a cup of coffee.I was so excited to receive this. I loved the coffee it made. It was quick, hot, and delicious. After two weeks though, it just stopped working.Does not workLove the Nespresso and flavor of the coffee. But the machine broke after only 6 weeks, leaks all over the counter. Amazon won\\'t accept the return, because I\\'ve missed the \"return window\" by a few days. I live overseas, so sending back to the manufacturer is not that simple.Exactly after 2 years the machine started leaking badly and it was properly maintained/descaled during it lifetime.\\n\\nVery frustrating as this is not fixable by us as the consumer....We returned this item. It was the incorrect model. (Larger footprint, larger pods)After 3 months, this coffee maker leaks all over my counter.Package came beat up and looks used. Didn’t get all flavors for the samples that came with it. I ordered new not used in very disappointedsame thing as other customers reported. leaking at the bottom of the machine. we used the machine max 20 times. just bad quality. and of course the return is not possible anymore.... do not buy please!This was bought as a gift but was dissatisfied after finding that it was not working properly. When it tries to brew, it did not hold the coffee and splatters everywhere.It came looking banned up and used, packing info removed. Opened it up and it\\'s literally missing pods. No milk foamer. This is ridiculous. I\\'ve requested a refund. I\\'m scared to order a replacement.This thing started short circuiting only weeks after I bought it... Now they won\\'t let me return it. Can someone from Amazon reach out to me about this defective product?Thx to Amazon customer service, I was able to get a refund! This machine leaks water like crazy & I do not recommend it to anyone! I read online other people have had the same issues. Nespresso has made a bad product & I will not be buying one until they fix the problem or come up with an updated model. See the picture I took of the water leak.Don’t expect this machine to live longer than a yr. I’ve had two in 1.5 yrs - same leaking problem. I’m going back to my Keurigbest cup of coffeeMy Vertuo Plus (from Amazon Services) was supposed to be new , but it does not look new and did not come with a plastic covering that I see in the YouTube videos showing unboxing of new Vertuo Plus machines. I\\'m returning it. Unbelievable!Made great coffee but started leaking after a couple months. Dumps half the coffee on the counter. Customer service sucks! Has been sitting idle for 9 months. Overpriced junk - Probably going on the trash.The coffee maker is not producing hot coffee.The heater probably is not enough to produce hot coffee/water.They need to improve the temperature of the water heater to produce the right water temp fior coffee.love itWe bought this after hearing great things and knowing we liked Nespresso coffee. Everything was working great and today, just shy of 2 months having it, it broke. The machine turns red and won\\'t work. I will try and get it fixed, but so disappointed.Love....Love.....Love my Nespresso!!Consumer beware\\n\\nDon\\'t be fool like I was ... broke down, called Nespresso support, and they didn\\'t care. Actually they wanted to purchase more capsule without a working machine. That says it all.Terrible experience with this selller. Product package was so heavily taped I had to destroy the box to open it. Then I plug it in and it doesn’t work. Now I have to buy some type of solution to get it to work. F-.Unfortunately my machine broke after not even one month of use. Top bottom of machine malfunctioned and does not \"click\" anymore.\\nHad to return to get my money back...Machine makes great coffeeLame. Small water tank, cheap plastic build. I have the larger Vertuo device at home and love it. Bought this for the studio and it sucks. Don\\'t waste your money on this one. Capsules don\\'t eject, get stuck either in the extraction position, or in the ejection slot. Machine needs to warm up each time its used. Wish I had returned within the return window.Bought it 6.5 months ago and it is now leaking coffee all over the counter.Missing complimentary pods! I bought the non-Deluxe version a couple weeks before and loved it so much I convinced 3 of my coworkers to go in on this. We love the machine, but we\\'re disappointed that someone took the pods. One of the packaging tabs was obviously already opened. We just didn\\'t notice it until after we set it up in our office.It work, but the coffee temperature is not hot enough, only warm. if you do not drink it within 5 minutes, need to discard.\\nWish the coffee maker has adjustment for temperature.We have had this machine for about two years. It worked great in the beginning, now I want to toss it out the window. It frustrates me because it doesn\\'t work half the time, and we burn through pods when troubleshooting. I hate this machine! I would put it in the trash but my husband is more patient than I am. Positive note: the color is awesome.Gave this as a Christmas gift to my husband in December 2019, now 4 months later its leaking and useless and I\\'m stuck with hundreds of dollars worth of nespresso unless I buy another one..... Hmm? Maybe buy directly from Nespresso next time?Love itThis machine was great for a few months but it now leaks A LOT, I apparently can\\'t return it to Amazon as it doesn\\'t give me the option. Don\\'t buy!!!Took out of the box for the first time and pressed the power button. Started flashing red and never got it to brew 1 cup of coffee. Returned.Amazing product!! High quality of manufacturing!very please, shipped promptly, exactly as describedThis product wouldn\\'t work. I gave it as a Christmas gift and by the time they tried it, it was too late to return it.I can’t tell you how excited I was to get this. And how disappointed I was when it failed. I followed the instructions to clean the machine. Nothing. I called support. They walked me through the process. Nothing. Defective. Within 15 minutes. Defective. Junk. Do not buy this thing.I was so excited to use my new machine but I opened it up to see that all off the pods in the little sample pack had been taken out! So sad! Will have to order my own and then try out the machineLike many others have said, your machine will eventually leak to the point you\\'ll have to send the it in for repair. Unfortunately it happened to me after only 3 months. The coffee was good while it lasted, but back to Keurig for me.Does not turn on at all. Wasted so many pods trying to start it.LOVE it.Began using on 12/26/2019 and we loved it, until about a month later when it began leaking coffee all over the counter and the machine was broken! After reading through reviews this seems to be a frequent problem! Extremely disappointed as this is the best coffee!This product leaked after 14 months of use. Nespresso Customer Service was terrible. I was promised a callback from a Customer Service Manager and that never happened. Many phone calls to them with no help.We began to notice leaking within the first year and tried the recommended cleaning procedure, but still leaks. Was so excited about the product at first, but lifespan is very limited. Unsure why the recommended procedure did not work, but have gone back to pour over for time being.\\nMay try the new version with the euro proportions - enjoyed one in the hotel while traveling. Maybe this one has less issues... For the price of these machines, I would expect them to last more than a year. Unfortunately we had not purchase a protection plan in advance, so ours may become garbage, unless there is a way to recycle?Made well. Quiet. Easy to clean.Arrived damaged. When I sent it back for a refund I was given a partial credit and refunded amount on my Amazon card.Love the coffee!Bought this for my mom on mothers day. Followed all of the directions perfectly. Once it started brewing, the coffee kept leaking from the bottom of the machine. Did everything I could, it kept leaking through the bottom. Pure trash.Loved this machine for 2 whole days!! Then it would not brew properly. If I was lucky I would get a teaspoon out of each brew. I troubleshoot and followed the directions but still not working. Returning this tomorrow.Please read all the reviews before purchasing. Makes a great cup of coffee BUT like warm at best. Read ALL the reviews and online article with this complaint. I read but ignored, wasted over 100 bucks. Great coffee but cold in under 2 mins...Bought this Nespresso, it lasted a couple months then quit working. The replacement came and wouldn\\'t turn on at all. Poor quality product.I only had it for a month and it has stopped working. Extremely disappointed!!! I love the pods and all of the different types of Nespresso.Can\\'t figure out the disconnect. I sampled a cup of coffee from this machine at a Bloomingdales pop up shop. The coffee was hot and delicious. I ordered this machine and the coffee temperature is 160 degrees!!! I called Nespresso and they said the coffee temperature should be 180-190. My machine doesn\\'t come close. I will be returning this immediately.simply amazingIgnores the pod. Keeps requesting descale even after doing it.Great machine!Coffee tastes great but water leaks on my countertop from the back of the unit... I have to send in for repair. I guess I am not alone with this issueWe bought 3 for Christmas gifts. 2 out of the 3 leaks water and coffee from inside the machine within 2 months. I\\'m afraid to ask about the 3rd. We now have two machines that don\\'t work...Sent a very used product. I will be returningIt was not creamy nor frothy. It had been used too. Very disappointed. Returned it.best coffee everAwesome cup of coffee! I set this up in my bedroom. On my day off I can sit there with a cup of coffee in my pj\\'s until I\\'m ready to get the day!Makes GREAT coffee. But three months of use leaks all over the counter.Really like the machine but dislike the lack of available flavors and pods are more expensive than older model.Where have you been all my life! Great tasty and foamy expresso even without any milk! Hot enough for mee and very easy to make! I didn’t give this a 5 because has a very expensive cups!!!!🤯 Really, why???Did not work out of the box. Called Nespresso technical support and have to send out for repair. Very unsatisfied.Works perfectly!I have this exactly 2 months and it isn\\'t working, it goes to a green light and nada..not motor whirring, nothings...I just wanted a treat in the morning and this has given me nothing but trouble!Stopped working after just 2 weeks.\\nInsufficient remedies from Nespresso support.\\nCustomer has to go through the trouble of packaging, returning, and receiving on their end before refund is initiated, (hopefully).Awesome frickin coffee!This product has been nothing but problems, I’m over my month for an amazon return so now need to wait 3 weeks for a repair through nespresso.It stopped working after 2 weeks. I purchased it for my mom for Christmas and it stopped working at the beginning of the year. Pretty bummed because she enjoyed the coffee when it did work.We really enjoy our nespresso, so much we bought this one as a gift. Unfortunately it didn’t come with the milk frother as promised!! So disappointed! Especially since I can’t even order the same item or replace it since it’s out of stock.The first item i received leaked from the bottom the first time we used it. We received a replacement and it leaked after a month. I will be returning for refund and finding another model.This is the second machine in 4 months that has quit working!Esta cafetera al salir el café se tranca y no sale casi cafeAwesome!!!!!Product stated New but once received box looked old like of it was used!Love this machine!I have no idea how it makes coffee or tastes. Very 1st use, all the liquid came pouring from the bottom of the machine. Disappointed. Waiting now for Nespresso to ship a replacement.Hardly got any use out of it. Bought it for my gf who has a similar unit at work and it never worked for her. Flashes red and won\\'t brew.These machines have EXPIRED Coffee. Very Disappointing.The product itself would have been great except it was missing the Aeroccino Milk Frother that was supposed to be included in the bundle. Ended up buying it from Target (with the promised Aeroccino included) and sending this one back.My mornings are filled with joy now that I have this delicious coffee. It is an elegant machine and so easy to use. I just had to change my review. Literally one day after I received my coffee maker the prce dropped $30 - nearly 25 percent.The heating element was broken and I had to return it! A pain to pack it up and send back!Horrible product. Not working from day one\\n\\nGot electric shock when i plug it in. Luckily I am still aliveThis was the worst purchase I\\'ve ever made on Amazon. Zero stars. Terrible. Do not buy it! It broke within the week and you can\\'t buy pods like tea or cocoa to work with it. Stay away!!!!!!! Awful.Play VideoI wanted a plain cup of coffee and this only allows you to make a pod with crema (which is gross) or an expresso. Amazon has been wonderful in letting me return the item for something else. Their customer service is 5 Stars!!!!Lasted a little over a year, was a hassle while it was \"working\" as it would often get stuck in the up position. Called Nespresso and they wouldn\\'t do anything for me. Customer lost.Se rompió al mes de comprada y perdí todo mi dineroDid the Cleaning cycle, it acted a little weird. Pressed the lever to go up lid went up, pressed the lever to go down and nothing. Machine broken from the getgoDidn’t work. Would not brew coffee. Contacted Nespresso and they confirmed that it was defectivebroke after 20 months of light use almost 200 usd down the drain. a little silly to have a 1 year warranty on something so expensive. no more nespresso for me.Very upset with that I bought this!! It worked so I got rid of the box before I realized none of the pods I bought that was suggested don\\'t even work with this machine. STUCK WITH THIS MACHINEThe machine was great at first. However, It started leak coffee(I wish it was water) after 6 months of use. Customer service was useless.I love coffee and have been drinking it daily for over 60 years. But I am the only coffee drinker in my house, and the hassle of making a decent single cup of coffee was always a problem until Keurig came out with its single brew coffee maker in 2006. The coffee was never great, but it was decent, and the coffee came out hot, which I liked.\\n\\nRecently I acquired the Nespresso Veturo Plus ,and now I’ve finally found my ideal coffee maker. It is more convenient to use than the Keurig, and the coffee is produced is much better. It appears that this coffee maker is also sold with Breville and De’Longhi labels, but I suspect all three are identical.\\n\\nThis coffee maker is very easy to use. Unlike the Keurig, it doesn’t have a setting that keeps the water always hot, but it only takes a minute or so to heat up. The water reservoir in the Nespresso is larger, meaning you don’t have to refill it as often, and it is much easier to remove, refill and replace than the Keurig. Cleaning is easier, and the Veturo takes up less room on my kitchen counter.\\n\\nWhile the Nespresso Veturo line of coffees aren’t as extensive as what is available for Keurig, I found the Nespresso coffees offered to be excellent, with a range of strengths that exceeds that available from my Keurig. In addition, I sometimes enjoy a double espresso, which the Nespresso makes pretty well.\\n\\nI have read complaints that the coffee doesn’t come out hot enough in the Nespresso machine. But it does. What’s needed is a good, heated insulated cup to keep the coffee hot. I have found the BTaT- Insulated Coffee Mugs, Glass Tea Mugs, Set of 4 (12 oz, 350 ml), Double Wall Glass Coffee Cups, available from Amazon to be the ideal cup. To make a cup of coffee in the morning I first turn the coffee make on by pressing the button on the top. I then fill a coffee mug with water and heat it for two minutes in the microwave, meanwhile making my breakfast. When breakfast is almost ready, I pour out the hot water from my cup and brew a cup of coffee in the Nespresso. If I time it right, breakfast and coffee are ready at the same time, and my coffee is nice and hot for the time it takes to eat my breakfast. A great way to start a day.Great for workWorked for two months then stopped.I had to return my Nespresso Next model after two weeks due to several malfunctions. Even the instruction manual instructs to unplug it from the wall if it does not operate correctly. (Seriously?!) I ended-up unplugging just about every other cup. It was an absolutely Terrible machine in almost every way. I almost didn’t get the Plus model because of the pitiful Next model… but I did anyway, and am glad I did. So far I haven\\'t had any problem with this model at all. It has actually produced a good beverage everytime I try, which was impossible with the Next model. So if you have to choose between the two, in my opinion there is no choice at all. Go with the Plus model… definitely!My Vertuo Plus didn’t work the first day I tried to use it. I called the Nespresso helpdesk and they told me that Amazon had a defective batch that they refused to return. Don’t buy this junk.It started leaking in the back while brewing. Purchased it on Feb 2020 and in 5 mos, its no longer functioning correctly. Disappointed..The worst espresso machine.Play Video\\n I received the Nespresso vertuo plus Deluxe with damaged box, the welcome kit was missing and it was dirty and full with coffee Stains all over the item.Just got the machine total trash came !\\nI paid for brand new one and this looks like 5years used one cameNot great! problems with leaking.It made a good cup of coffee until it broke down :(((coffee start leaking from behind the machine after 3 months. Ruined our coffee tableI thought the materials and workmanship were inferior to the other Nespresso machine that I own. I also thought the functions were inferior. I returned it the same day that I received it. I am happy with my other Nespresso machineThe water tank leaks. Have to empty the dispenser after every use.This is our second time ordering this machine and we love it until it leaks all over the place. Great idea but poorly made.Product may be defective or counterfeit as it broke after 5 days.Had the machine for 10 months and it quit working. It has been leaking for the last 6 months, even after cleaning as instructed. Will try another brand machine.Machine stopped working after 3-4 times of using. Very disappointed!I have not used it for a month and it leaks out the back. Now they want me to send it back for repair.My machine broke down after 4 weeks!After 1 1/2 months stopped working!!!Don\\'t bother with the warranty. When your water tank starts to leak (which it will), Call Nespresso and they will replace it with last years model which works GREAT (it\\'s just a little less chic looking)We have only owned this Nespresso for 4 months and it’s already leaking all over the counter when you make a coffee.I ran the machine for the first time and coffee grounds came outCoffee tasted blah. No flavor. Returning it!Leaks coffee all over the place. Extremely disappointing. Awaiting word from customer service.My husband bought this for me for Christmas 2019 and we could not be happier with the quality of the coffee and the machine is still brewing away with no problems. Seriously can\\'t go on enough about the taste of this coffee, it\\'s coffee house quality, if you love coffee, you will love this machine.\\n\\nThe Cons:\\n- The pods are over a dollar each and can\\'t be purchased just anywhere. But still cheaper than Starbucks.\\n- The de-scaling business is mandatory and confusing and if done incorrectly will shut the machine down and the instruction book could be clearer. I had to call customer service to walk me through the process of button pushing at the right time in the correct order but it was simple once being tutored and they stayed on the phone with me the entire time.\\n- The pods have to be returned to Nespresso to be recycled but they provide a free shipping bag with a pre addressed, paid label that you can pick up at any Nespresso store or add to any online order.\\n\\nThe Pros:\\n- My experience with customer service for this product has been AWESOME! They are available anytime you need them and they are so helpful with questions or solutions to problems.\\n- We order the pods conveniently online and we usually get them between 1-3 days with free shipping over $35. They offer free samples to try with your coffee order.\\n- The coffee is GOOD, I mean ridiculously good, with many flavors, cup sizes, types of barista blends and espressos. Superior in taste and quality to any other pod coffee.\\n- It\\'s smart and knows how to brew each type of coffee and it will let you know when your water reservoir needs refilling and when to de-scale\\n- Aside from learning how to perform the mandatory de-scaling maintenance, this machine is really very easy to use. Open lid, insert pod, close lid, wait for green light, push button, drink hot delicious coffee with beautiful crema with every cup.Broke after 6 months and warranty support is non existentThanks for the broken nespresso machineThis is one dynamic duo. Coffee maker makes espresso, double espresso and regular coffee. Just insert the proper pod. And the milk frothier is the perfect pairing. My lattes are just as good as ⭐️bucks and a third the price. Won’t take long for this beauty to pay for itself! ❤️ ☕️The machine that I got doesn’t work. I’m returning.Broke within 7 days\\nOtherwise was good\\nSend it backVery hard instructions it is hard to read small letters. Confusing I would never recommend this only if u are a geniusI paid for and ordered the one with the 60 ounce water tank and got the 40 ounce one. Returning it tomorrow. Very disappointed.Failed to work.Broke after 1 month of use.Can only make nespresso coffee which is not very good and very bitter. Just get a regular coffee maker.This started leaking coffee al over and I haven’t even had it 6 months. Do not purchase this junk!Doesn\\'t work after 11 months. Over half of the coffee leaks out onto the counter.Best coffee machine I ever bought. Really enjoy it in the afternoon before I have get up and make dinnerAlready broke...lasted less than three month. When I make coffee it leaks all over the counter.Broke after 2 months, water started leaking out the bottom of machine! Nespresso really let me down.Recomendado 100%I reviewed item with damaged box so I’m returning it and purchased new from Nespresso.comNot even 6 months no power. Not workingI Bought in July and in January it stopped working. Very poor assistance by Amazon and Nespresso.Disposable, buy every year, or in my last case 7mo. machine. No more.Coffee is not hot and milk frother does not get milk hot either- disappointed in product and wish I would not have boughtThis machine made great coffee but it broke after 2 months of occasional use. I\\'m not sure it is a product wide problem but for the price it should last longer than 2 months.Machine started leaking after 6 months. Seller not responsiveUnfortunately the coffee maker never worked and I was not able to make even one cup of coffee.\\nI will be sending this machine back.\\nDisappointed!Made one cup out of the box then broke. This is my second one. First one was awesome. Will send this backWorked for 6 months and died!, used it twice a day.Bought this model twice and returned it for the same reason. It leaks water.So disappointed with this machine. Only drips out two tablespoons of liquidOnly had it since September and it stopped working hardly any water comes out ...really disappointedGreat machine but was missing my welcome pods... so that made my purchase very unpleasant .....I have tried all of the Nesspresso vertiro pods from 6 intensity to 11 and they are all tastelessUsed it once and it stopped working. Getting a replacement from Amazon January 11th. Not a happy camper.It works great but I don’t like the only way to control the size is by buying the specific capsules. Unit is also very large.We made coffee in a Nespresso machine while we were on vacation and we fell in love with it! We bought this Nespresso machine as soon as we got home. We followed all of the directions, but the coffee was watery every time. The machine made horrible coffee. We are returning it. Very disappointing!NOT WHAT IS PICTURED. Trying to sell the old model.

Returned for a refund.Play Video\\n Have had this machine for a week now and very happy! I have returned previous Nespresso machines because I found the coffee to not be hot enough and lack of Crema but this one does the trick! Also perfect if you have a small apartment and limited counter space, you can move the water container to the side if preferred. Highly recommend, also happens to be less expensive than other Vertuo machines!It doesn’t work I need to return it ... really bad designI wanted to like this product. I enjoy the coffee but in less than 10 uses, it leaked coffee badly. I had it repaired under warranty and again in less than 10 uses, it leaked again. The problem now is that it isn\\'t under warranty anymore and they refuse to stand behind their product other than wanting to charge me to repair it or give me 35% off a new purchase. Given the number of times this product has been used and that there is clearly a problem with this model (I have 3 friends with the same model and same problem), this is unacceptable.\\n\\nI would steer away from this product and either look for a different model or else find another company which stands behind their product.Works so well! Literally in love with this coffee maker! Everything came in perfect shape and care.Broke after five monthsDO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT! Purchased brand new Virtuo machine and have been using for approximately 4 months. Coffee is good but expensive which is no surprise. Our house uses skim milk so that is what I tried in the accompanying brother. Worked great! About three days ago the brother stopped frothing. It still heats and agitates but as soon as it stops the foam collapses to \"thin soap bubbles\" in appearance and all foam disappears. Called Nespresso and explained problem, they said it was the milk. I explained that we always bought same milk from same store and it had worked fine. However, to make certain, before calling Nespresso, I tried whole milk, 1% low fat, and then Half & Half, ALL instantly collapsed just as the original skim. Agent insisted it was the milk even though I explained that problem started with milk from open container which was sued next day (a gallon lasts us 3 - 4 days). They will do nothing, they insist it is the milk. Utterly unprofessional company marketing a complex machine which they are incapable of technically supporting. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK, TERRIBLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH. I will throw my unit in trash this morning, it is of no further use and I will not buy another brother as they recommend.Sometimes you need to eat crow. My original review was not very favorable due to the fact you can not reuse the pods. I need to backtrack and say that you can reuse the pods if you do not eject them. However, you will not be very pleased with the results. However they come up with their grind calculations, the pods are spent after being used. Even if you adjust the water lever, which I did, the resulting \"second\" cup is horrifying. While I still disagree with them programming in a code where you can not reuse the pods after ejection, ultimately it doesn\\'t matter. Still, one star off for the first machine being broke and the inconvenience of availability of the pods. Online only, and most are only available thru Nespresso. I have heard that you can buy pods from a Nespresso Boutique, if you can find one. (for the Vertuoline pods)\\n\\nThe first one I bought was broken out of the box. The lid was locked closed and it constantly flashed an amber light. After an hour of wasted time googling, I made another trip to Bed Bath & Beyond to swap it out, where even they determined it was faulty. I ended up taking their display model off the shelf as that was the only one they had left.\\nI actually LOVE the coffee/alto/lunga/espresso that this machine brews. The froth is WAY better than my friends original model. Here is the issue I have....they have designed the pods to only be used once. This is akin to the home printing manufacturers programming codes into their ink cartridge\\'s so you can\\'t refill and reuse them. This is nothing more than Nespresso\\'s way to get you to buy more pods more often. This machine is electronic in the sense that it uses bar codes on their pods to determine the pod size and relative parameters to brew a perfect cup. I applaud them for this, but to TELL ME that I can\\'t use a pod twice is BULL***!! There are those of you who believe this is perfectly acceptable behavior. Well not me. These pods are 20-30 percent more expensive than the original pods, which of those you can use as many times as you wish, and the Vertuo pods have very limited place of purchases. So now I\\'m in a quandary whether to keep or return this, yet again, for the original model. I simply do not like it when companies pull this crap. You buy their very expensive machines that use only their expensive exclusive pods, and then I can\\'t get the most out of them. If I want a watered down \"second\" cup of coffee, that should be my decision, NOT yours!! And don\\'t feed me this garbage about it possibly damaging the machine!I had high hopes for this machine. We had bought the original version but it had mechanical issues so it was returned. At first I was reluctant to buy a machine that I could only purchase their pods. I got over that (as long as the coffee is good).\\n\\nHere are my results after several months of use:\\nThe high spinning of the Vertuo creates a dry coffee foam (they call it crema).\\nIt looks cool but tastes terrible. I have to scoop the foam off before drinking my coffee.\\nThis machine will not dispense hot water only. If you want to add more water to dilute a strong coffee or make a hot chocolate, you are out of luck.\\nI purchased the variety pack of pods and have yet to find one I really like. They are all quite strong (and I like strong coffee). These are so strong I have to add half/half to dilute.Brought a Vertuo Plus machine believing the description that it could be used to make a 14 oz. cup of coffee. Since my purchase Nespresso no longer produces the Alto (large) pods. Still shows the 14 oz. cup size in the machines Amazon description. Regretting my purchase and am back to using my coffee pot. Too late to get a refund.Missing parts from order. Had to returnThe DeLonghi Nespresso VertuoPlus coffee and espresso maker is extremely simple and obvious to operate, brews a good cup of coffee, and a great espresso.\\n\\nMost people will look at Nespresso machines and will want to compare it to the Keurig coffee pod machines. In a nutshell, Keurig has far more varieties of coffee, the machines cost much less, and the pods are cheaper (per pod $0.45-$0.65 Keurig vs. $1.10 Nespresso). So why would one buy a Nespresso? Well… it comes down to the taste and quality of the coffee and the ability to brew great espresso. The Nespresso coffees that I have tried are rich, with a deeper flavor, and have a delicious crema layer on top. For me, the Nespresso coffee is better than say the Keurig coffees that I have tasted to date..\\n\\nI like coffee. I’ve owned a classic Nespresso espresso machine also made by  DeLonghi  for almost 6 years. I have a  Bonavita  coffee brewer, and used and discarded an embarrassing number of other devices over the years. When I want to drink a lot of coffee, I brew a pot from local roasters. When I want a quick coffee, I used to use 2 classic Nespresso pods to create an Americano (full cup of coffee from espresso and extra water). NOW, I use the VertuoPlus pods for a cup of coffee.\\n\\nThe coffees and espresso pods.\\nThe VertuoLine pods have a limited selection of coffees and espressos. The DeLonghi machine ships with a variety pack of pods to try. The espressos that I tried were hot, had a nice crema and had a deep and rich flavor. I liked most of the coffees that I tried. They tended to be on the dark, rich side and had a deeper flavor than I have gotten from a Keurig machine. I found that I really did not like any of the flavored coffees that I sampled.\\n\\nThe cost for the espresso pods VertuoLine is $0.85 versus Nespresso classic pods $0.70-$0.80. The VertuoLine coffees are $1.10 per pod. In the past to create a cup of Americano coffee I was using 2 classic Nespresso pods at a time… so the VertuoLine is actually cheaper for a cup of coffee for me.\\n\\nThe pods are only available through Nespresso online or one of the rare local boutique stores. I ordered VertuoLine pods online and was very pleased to see them arrive the next day once and typically 2 to 3 days. The only caveat with the Nespresso VertuoLine pods that I see is that there are not as many varieties of the espresso for the VertuoLine (4 choices) as there are for the Nespresso classic pods (21 choices, ignoring Lungo). There are 10 choices for the coffees. I hope to see the variety grow over time.\\n\\nHeat of the brew.\\nSome reviews of other Nespresso VertuoLine machines (not this machine) criticized the lack of heat for the coffee and espressos. I measured the coffee with a good instant thermometer and got temperatures of 161F. This is a hot cup of coffee which made me very happy.\\n\\nThe DeLonghi VertuoPlus Machine.\\nThis machine is an example of simple-to-use functionality with a sleek, elegant design. There is a large water reservoir for the coffee and espressos, and a large discarded pod container (useful because the VertuoLine pods are a bit large). To use the machine, plug it in, hit the button on top (the only button on the machine) to turn it on and then push a wide lever on the front “up” to open the machine (via electric motor). Put the pod in, push the lever down to close the lid (via electric motor) and hit the button on top to brew. The machine takes about 25 seconds to heat up and start brewing. That is it.\\n\\nA small critique.. I would like the tray that the coffee cup is placed on to be about 3/4\" larger. My mugs for coffee barely fit on the current tray. I am a little concerned that using an electric motor to open and close the lid may cause issues over the years if the motor wears out... especially for something that could be done without a motor (granted, it looks cool).\\n\\nOverall… this is a great, easy to use, beautiful machine. I am loving the coffee.Machine constantly leaks, leaving huge water puddles everywhere!\\n\\nOtherwise, coffee is great. For more details of how this product is actually used, please see the attached video review. Here is my written review:\\n\\nThis is a very nice machine. My husband and I love all types of coffee and welcomed this machine with open arms. We currently have a regular brewer and a Keurig. One would think that this machine is extremely expensive, but if you compare it to the Keurig, it is actually cheaper, and it is actually on sale via Amazon Prime.\\n\\nOnce again, in comparison to the Keurig, the pods run about the same as far as price is concerned. You can get them here on Amazon, or you can buy them from the Nesperesso website. They even have a members only program that allow you to get these pods, sometimes for a sale price and other goodies you wouldn\\'t normally be able to obtain.\\n\\nUnboxing: The machine is packaged securely, and it comes with the machine, the water reservoir, the drip catcher and the plug. There are about 4 notches that you can put the drip tray/cup holder on, starting from the bottom to the top. The water reservoir has a suction cup that moves the water from the container into the coffee mechanism. Actual contents: Capsule container, machine, water tank, lid, adjustable water tank arm, adjustable cup support and capsule container.\\n\\nSimple instructions. You\\'ll need to follow the instructions manual and rinse the machine first by running 27 fl oz of water through the machine.\\n\\nCoffee preparation instructions: Fill water tank with water, turn the machine on, place cup under coffee outlet, place coffee pod/capsule (flat side up) in machine, carefully push down lid and hit start button.\\n\\nThings to note: You don\\'t have to force the lid up and down. Once you pull or push softly, it has a soft open and soft close on its own. So too much force may break the mechanism that opens and closes it.\\n\\nWhen you open the lid to place ANOTHER capsule in, the machine will automatically eject the old one into the pod dispenser.\\n\\nThere are three sizes of cups recommended for this machine: Alto-14fl oz, Coffee-7.77fl oz and Expresso 1.35fl oz. If you want to top off your cup, you can simply press the start button once more and a little at a time will flow into the cup. Just make sure you have the proper sized cup.\\n\\nAgain, see the attached video for a more visual look at this machine.\\n\\nI might also add that the machine comes with a capsule sampler that includes 12 capsules. The nicely packaged box gives a background and strength of each pod. I\\'m gathering that all the red pods are decaffeinated related. The flavors run from Intens (and no, that\\'s not spelled incorrectly), Caramelizi, Elvazi, Giorni, Voltes, Half Caffeinat and Altissi. And before you start wondering if your eyes are playing tricks on you, there are 12 samples, but there are 16 descriptions.\\n\\nThe contents of the box also include instruction manual and a welcome card.Worked good for 2 months, after the milk frother stopped working. Bad experience!I\\'m a big fan of these machines and the way they make coffee, but I have grave concerns about them not lasting much over a year and (what\\'s worse), not being repairable. My first one lasted less than a year, the replacement only 3-4 months, and now I just spent > $111 (after unrepairable red light factory discount) for a third , with the last one having been unceremoniously demoted to the dumpster, as suggested by Nespresso. If we had any sense, we would build such things to last a bit longer than a year. Your mileage may vary.I used it for just few days and stopped working bad product qualityThe capacity of the 2-cup espresso is too small and the machine is too noisy vs any other similar machine I owed. I must make two consecutive 2-cup espressos amplifying the breakfast available timeI come from a family of coffee snobs, so I was a bit skeptical about this product. However, I was blown away by this machine. All the parts were carefully packed and obviously high quality. The box of sample capsules looks like a box of Godiva chocolates, complete with detailed descriptions of each type of coffee and espresso, and the \"bonus\" aeroccino milk frother is worth it\\'s weight in gold (more on that later). I drink decaf coffee, and it\\'s so hard to find a coffee that is rich and flavorful. Most of them taste \"flat.\" I was truly impressed by both the decaf espresso and decaf coffee capsules. The espresso tasted every bit as wonderful as the best caffeinated espresso I\\'ve ever had (before I switched to decaf). My daughter and son drink caffeinated coffee and quickly went through the remaining capsules.My husband says he still prefers his pour over coffee, but he really likes the Nespresso espresso. My daughter, however, prefers the coffee capsules, especially the convenience of popping a one in the machine and drinking a cup of coffee within a minute. Of course the bad news is the expense of replacement capsules. At about $1 a cup, it\\'s cheaper than stopping by a coffee shop but still about twice the price of making pour over coffee (our usual routine). I plan to buy replacement capsules in bulk (after payday...), but I thought I would try re-using the capsules with my own coffee. I ordered  My-Cap\\'s Cap to Reuse Capsules for Nespresso VertuoLine Brewers  and was very pleased with the product. You simply cut the foils off the used capsules, clean them, add your own coffee, cover with a filter, then press in the plastic cap. It took 3 tries to get the right amount of coffee so the machine wouldn\\'t reject it, but now I can get it right every time. It takes a little extra time than it does to just pop in a purchased capsule, but I set it up the night before to save time. Moving on to the aeroccino: you need this in your life! It makes perfect foam each and every time in about one minute with the simple press of a button. I use 2% milk in my lattes and espressos, and the milk is the perfect temperature with a thick, rich foam. Sometimes I will just make a steamer and add some vanilla or flavored syrup (you can make your own-- just google recipes for them). I also use it to make amazing hot chocolate. My daughter puts half and half in the aeroccino and pours it in her coffee so she isn\\'t dumping cold half and half into hot coffee.BTW, the aeorccino that comes with this set is sold by itself for over $200, so it truly is a great bonus item. One last note: be sure that any accessories or pods you buy are specifically made for VertuoLine (not the original line) because the sizes are different.I am looking for zenius nespresso but prime besoz keep hitting me with this vertuo brand thinking I may change my mind but noCoffee is now an event in our house. We LOVE this machine. We are moderate coffee drinkers (2 cups ea. in the morning) and never really gave our tired old cup a second thought until we tried a perfect cup of coffee. Honestly, this is by far the best coffee I have ever had.\\nThe machine is 172.00 and is ready to work out of the box. It heats up fast (15-20 seconds) and comes with 8 different coffee\\'s and 4 espresso\\'s so you can get an idea of what you like.\\nPods are 1.10 each and cheapest at this time directly from Nespresso, however they often have specials and new machine owners get discounted coffee and a few freebies with your first 3 orders.\\nWhy would you spend over 150.00 for a coffee maker? Or, 1.10 for a cup of coffee? Well, as soon as you taste it you will find out. We ran out of pods for 2 days and I was almost in a panic because they only sell them from Amazon, Nespresso direct and some Targets (but not in our area) I quickly ordered enough to last us at least 3 months.\\nThis is definitely a treat yourself item, and if you love coffee buy it! If you hit a coffee house a few times a week then you will actually save a little money.\\n*If you are wondering what the difference is between the Originaline vs the Vertuoline , please see more information below, it does a great job explaining what the differences are and why this machine is better, at this time, than the original product (for coffee and espresso only).\\nThe only drawback I have initially is that, at this time, there are no generic pods, which are usually less expensive, and no refillable pods.\\nWhen you re-order your coffee from Nespresso they also will send you bags for your used coffee pods which you can then recycle by dropping off at a UPS store or having them pick up. This was very important to me and one of the reasons I never purchased a Keurig. Lastly, I have had Keurig coffee and other pod machines in the past, but the VertuoPlus is by far the better cup of coffee.\\nIf you want to try it before purchasing it, many Williams and Sonoma stores have Nespresso tastings, which will give you an idea how really fantastic the coffee is.\\nA solid 5 stars and a great way to start out your day by treating yourself!\\n- Upgrades/differences with VertuoLine vs Originaline from Nespresso.\\n- Uses centrifusion technology, meaning instead of using a pump to push the coffee out, it actually spins the capsule over 7000 times in a minute making a much better cup of coffee.\\n- It recognizes each capsule individually and provides the best setting (based on a bar code) for that type of coffee.\\n- Much faster heat up time, now less than 20 seconds.\\n- No need to change settings based on coffee strength or espresso, machine does that for you.\\n- Machine holds up to 14 used capsules which then can be recycled.\\n- Lastly, automatically turns off after 9 minutes.Item received was clearly previously used, very dirty.I received the Nespresso VertuoPlus by De\\'Longhi as a Chrismtas Present after adding it to my wish list. I have only had the machine for 1 week now so I will try to update my review in another 6 months to ensure the machine is still working as expected. Other reviews have mentioned the water tank leaking and the temperature not being hot enough for the machine. I have not experienced any leakage and in regards to the temperature it depends on the size of the capsule you are using. I find the coffee and Alto sizes to come out very hot. I have not utilized a lungo size yet but I do agree the espresso does not seem to come out hot and is only warm. I would say this is more so related to the type of cup I am using though. I do not have espresso size mugs yet so I am using a normal size ceramic coffee mug which is very cold to the touch. I think the size of the coffee mug I am using combined with the cold ceramic of the mug and the small ounces of espresso create the \"it doesn\\'t come out hot\" comments. I would recommend getting espresso mugs and then just running them under hot water so the mug is not cold before you utilize with the machine. I plan to order some and try this myself so I will let you know how it works. The taste of the espressos and coffees are amazing and the sample pack that comes with the machine is a great way to get you started to figure out which capsules you like best. I have yet to use the milk frother so again, I will follow-up once I have had the machine a little longer. I hope someone finds this review helpful. =)\\n\\nUpdate: It has been a year since I received my machine. I still have not bought espresso mugs to try to see if that helps the espresso come out more hot. However, the coffees still come out very hot and with good froth a year in. I would agree with the milk frother comments that it only warms the milk, it is not very hot so you would definitely want to drink any latte you make immediately.\\n\\nI still do not have any problems with leakage like other comments have mentioned. I did break the cup holder when I was cleaning it as I dropped it on the floor and one of the slot holders broke off. I called Nespresso customer service and it was very easy to get a replacement. The replacement cost about $9 and it was delivered within $2.\\n\\nI highly recommend if you are having a problem with any of your machines to call the customer service line. They were very helpful and I got someone right away.\\n\\nI am very glad I got this machine as a present. My Starbucks spending has good down by at least 75%. $1 per capsule versus $6 per Starbucks Drink, the savings adds up fast.I don’t know why everyone is praising this machine but I retuned mine cause the coffee is just barely warm and the taste is average. I had to put my cup in a microwave for 30 sec to make it hot, and even after that it gets cold very fast.\\nPlus it’s very expensive, $1.10 a cup is a rip off.This is the best !!! I’m a coffee snob and absolutely obsessedThere are many ways to make a good cup of coffee, and yes you may be able to produce a superior cup with an Aeropress or other \"bring your own grounds\" coffee makers. There\\'s no denying the convenience of popping in a pod and pressing a button for great coffee. While the Aeropress VertoPlus may look like just another pod based coffee/espresso maker, it\\'s much more.\\n\\nUnlike the proverbial \"K-Cup\", with Nespresso you\\'re really buying a luxury coffee system. While you can buy 3rd party refillable pods for the Nespresso, if you\\'re thinking of going that way, you\\'re probably not going to get the most out of this system. From the moment you unpack this stunning machine, it\\'s clear that everything is focused around providing a luxury experience. From unpacking to set up, DeLonghi has designed a machine that gives that wow, out of the box experience that you get from brands like Apple.\\n\\nThe machine is really a vehicle for the Nespresso Club, which you sign up for online and has an accompanying app. With the Nespresso Club you get white glove customer service. My test unit had a leaking water tank and the support rep had a new machine in my hands within 24 hours. I didn\\'t have to push or negotiate, that\\'s their standard operating procedure!\\n\\nThe machine itself works flawlessly, from a motorized pod lid to its one-touch operation. The accompanying milk frother is quick and efficient and produces thick foam (with the option for less thick foam). The coffee quality from the Nespresso pods is top notch, you get a sampler pack of 8 coffee pods and 4 espresso pods. Additional pods can be easily purchased via their Club for around $1-$1.80 a pod. This is more expensive than bring your own grounds, but it\\'s still significantly less expensive than a trip to Starbucks.\\n\\nThe Nespresso VertuoPlus does aerate the coffee/espresso at the end of its cycle. This is a little controversial as it boosts the appearance of the crema on the top of the coffee. Some coffee die hards cry foul at this, but this really isn\\'t the system for the real coffee geeks. By aerating the coffee the Nespresso VertoPlus creates an amazingly aromatic and flavorful experience.\\n\\nUnderstanding the environmental impact of pods, Nespresso ships a recycling bag which you can fill and return to them in a pre-paid envelope. It\\'s not only a nice touch, it\\'s smart business.\\n\\nUltimately, Nespresso has focused laser sharp on providing a luxury coffee experience, while it may be the penultimate coffee experience, it does truly deliver something special. The machine backed by the incredible service behind it make this an option for people who don\\'t want to \\'mess\\' with any part of the coffee experience but who still want an amazing coffee experience.machine stopped working after 4 months of use.I would not have bought this machine if I knew that the option for a 14 ounce cup was no longer there. This really chaps the butt, as it was a gift for a couple that would have enjoyed that option, now it is relegated to a weekend only option as the Keurig is much better option still.Item was received in used condition.Received the Nespresso machine on Nov 25, 2021. The box looked like an elephant sat on it. The owners manual is missing along with pamphlet 3/3. The machine seems to be working correctly but how do I know. This is our 1st time owning this thing.\\n\\nThis is an early Christmas gift but the condition of the box it came in makes us worry that it won\\'t make to Christmas. Disappointing to say the least. The condition is supposed to be new. But we suspect that this unit is refurbished.Going on 6 months . Machine can’t connect Bluetooth . I descaled my machine and it shows I still have to descale . Customer service is trash . Either go back to Starbucks or buy another one is your only options . Can’t update firmware or anything .UPDATE: We tried for about a month, but this thing just doesn’t make good iced coffee. We ended up buying another Breville to get us by until our stuff gets here. I wish I wouldn’t have wasted $200 giving this thing a shot. If you want real espresso and can swing it, skip this step and go straight for the real deal.\\n\\nI will preface this by saying we’re spoiled and are used to drinking iced espresso from a $600 Breville machine. This is NOT comparable to that - like, at all (as much as I want it to be). Even drinks from coffee shops aren’t as good as what we’re used to making at home.\\n\\nWe’re military and are moving, meaning we won’t have any of our stuff for a couple months. We wanted something to get us by in the meantime, but we really didn’t want a drip coffee maker or K-Cups. We wanted espresso — strong enough to make our usual iced coffee (8 oz milk with a double shot - nothing super fancy). I did a ton of research and decided this Nespresso was going to be as close as we were going to get.\\n\\nWe’ve been using it for over 2 weeks (2 coffee drinkers), multiple times a day - plenty of opportunity for trial and error. Hot coffee is honestly pretty good. These drinks, I feel, are comparable to a coffee shop. Iced coffee tastes watery, no matter what I do. (Less milk, more coffee, different pods, extra pods, ice, no ice, etc.) It tastes like the coffee and water are just separate, like they really don’t blend together smoothly at all. I feel like I’m drinking coffee water. (Again, this is after multiple attempts and a good $100 in different pods, in addition to what came with the machine).\\n\\nIf you’re NOT used to a full-blown espresso machine or ONLY want hot coffee, this may be the machine for you. If you’re in the market for good iced coffee, you really can’t replicate a true espresso machine using pods (no matter how fancy).I entered the Nespresso ecosystem kind of pessimistically. I\\'m a fan of freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee. The idea of trying coffee from a capsule system ran counter to how I thought coffee should be made. And, I\\'ve tried Keurig and have typically been disappointed. But there has been so much buzz surrounding Nespresso that I decided I would give it a try.\\n\\nThe verdict? I love it. I will continue to brew fresh coffee at home, but now I will supplement that with espresso and coffee from my my Nespresso machine. When I want just a single serving of coffee, it\\'s hard to beat the combined convenience and quality of this machine. I will share my experiences so far.\\n\\n* Setup was simple. I like the detachable water tank because I can take it over to the sink, fill it, and quickly connect it to the machine again (here \"connect\" just means set the tank down. It connects automatically without even a drop of water spilled anywhere). One minor setup complaint/caution: I was trying to open the top of the machine to see where the capsules go. I thought the machine was broke because it wouldn\\'t open. But the problem was that the machine MUST be plugged in, in order to open the top...because it is motorized. I am worried that someone might end up breaking their machine in an effort to open the top without it being plugged in. There is a simple cleaning procedure you should go through before brewing that first cup, but the directions for that are simple.\\n\\n* Brewing a cup of espresso, or a larger cup of coffee, is simple. Open the top, set a capsule in place, close the top, and press the start button. The machine automatically recognizes whether you are using a small capsule (for espresso) or a larger capsule (for a full cup of coffee), the water used is carefully adjusted for that capsule. It is easy to adjust the cup stand to accommodate the appropriately sized cup for whatever you are drinking. It is possible to adjust the amount of coffee that is brewed from a capsule, and to even change the default amounts. I have not made such adjustments (the defaults are good for my tastes), but the directions are simple for making adjustments.\\n\\n* The coffee is good! The Nespresso produces an interesting foam at the top of each cup of coffee or espresso. I like that foam. It is not cream, but the texture is creamy as a result. It is not a substitute for adding cream, but I find myself adding cream less often to my coffee when I use the VertuoPlus.\\n\\n* There are many varieties of coffee to choose from. Nespresso makes the whole process of coffee selection feel...elegant. The packaging of the capsules, the description of the coffee varieties...it all feels kind of classy. Note that there are far fewer places where you can buy Nespresso capsules than Keurig capsules. Keurig I can find anywhere. Nespresso...not so much. So, I end up ordering online (from Amazon, or direct from Nespresso), but there are a few local places where I can get them as well. I appreciate that Nespresso clearly indicates the dates that the capsules were made. If you buy your capsules from a popular source, you are likely to get freshly produced capsules. I have to complain a bit about the price of a cup of Nespresso coffee. It tends to hover around the dollar-per-cup range. Sure, that\\'s less expensive than buying a cup from a local shop. But, it is far more expensive than buying beans and brewing on your own.\\n\\n* I love that Nespresso offers an easy free way to recycle capsules. You can get an envelope from them that you fill with used capsules and send back to them for free. I appreciate that I don\\'t have to just toss these into a landfill. So, while I complain about the cost of a capsule, if that cost is going toward recycling the capsules, then it\\'s worth it.\\n\\n* The included Aeroccino 3 milk frother is a nice little bonus. It does not steam milk. But it will heat and froth your milk. I used 1% milk with pretty decent results. There are two options with the frother: short-press the power button to heat and froth, or long-press the power button to just froth. It was a nice addition to my coffee. Nespresso says the frother works best with whole milk. I\\'m going to try that next.\\n\\nSorry for the overly long review. If you are an experienced Nespresso user, then perhaps you already knew all this. But if you are like me...convinced that you can only get good coffee from freshly roasted, freshly ground beans, Nespresso might make a believer out of you. I like this little machine and have already begun ordering more capsules.I\\'ve been drinking Nespresso for six years. I\\'ve owned a Pixie (great machine), a Vertuo (also a great machine), and now this piece of junk. Granted, the Vertuo machines are designed for obsolescence, since the valves in the centrifuge fail after about three years. But for three years, my Vertuo made perfect coffee with every pod I fed it.\\n\\nOn the other hand, this piece of trash only makes decent coffee when it wants to. It\\'s also ugly, it takes up way too much counter space, and the swinging water reservoir is awkward and it tends to leak. If I had the choice I\\'d return this machine and get another Vertuo, but I\\'m past the 30-day return policy so I\\'ll likely sell it and order another one next year.\\n\\nIf you want my advice, if you want to drink coffee and espresso you should skip this cheap piece of plastic garbage and get the original Vertuo machine with the metal top. Or if you just want to drink espresso, get a Pixie. The Pixie will last forever and you can always make an Americano by adding hot water to whatever it pours.Machine they sent me just doesn’t actually work at all. I was so excited to get home and use it and instead I spent an hour on the phone with Nespresso customer service trying troubleshooting techniques only for them to tell me to return it since it is dis-functionalI purchased this recently and it arrived yesterday. Yet to get it to make a cup of coffee. The instruction manual is a joke, with light font and all languages mixed together. I plugged it in, put the pod in and pressed the coffee button, nothing happens. I even tried waiting in case it needed to heat up, and opening and closing the top again, but still nothing!! Don\\'t waste your money. I ended up using my Keurig yesterday and today. Guess this is a lesson to be careful what you think you want.I\\'m a newbie to the espresso game, but I just moved into a new place and wanted to get a machine. I avoided the costly ones and went for the basic DeLonghi set up, with a milk frother. That machine pales in comparison to the Nespresso. For a beginner, I wanted a simple one-button espresso maker. I realize the DeLonghi is a more traditional espresso maker where you do the process yourself, the need to monitor the machine so it doesn\\'t overflow is annoying if you want to step away. Though it can add up over time, I decided to go with a pod machine after my DeLonghi experience.\\n\\nThe Nespresso fits my needs perfectly. It looks sleek, the set up and cleaning is super easy. It\\'s inexpensive and honestly, the Nespresso pods have such a distinct variety and good flavors that I don\\'t need to venture outside the brand. I love the simplicity of this machine and how good it tastes. 10/10 in my opinion honestly. I feel like I got something with real value because the cost is in the range of other inexpensive espresso machines but this one operates super clean and looks great.We bought this machine for the opportunity to make 14 ounce coffees. They were the best! However, Nespresso has DISCONTINUED ALL 14 OZ PODS!! The machine is worthless to us after only 18 months. I feel duped by Nespresso.But I didn\\'t want to put another store out of business also I am super impatient so I bought it at Macy\\'s for $161 and now it\\'s going for $116! Damn and I thought I got a good deal.\\n\\nI truely love this thing. It makes coffee (5oz and 7oz cups) double espresso, espresso (three different blends/intensities) and altos (14oz I suppose you could use for multiple cups and only waste one pod vs 2 but you\\'d have to stand there and switch before it over pours. It\\'s obviously for a thermos but you can do either!)\\n\\nIt has so many flavors to choose from (coffee wise, including decaf) I just don\\'t like that some pods are labeled with just the logo of N. I have no idea what to expect when I use them. But for the ones with labels it makes it a lot easier to pin point what I like and want to order more of. I love foam and frothy drinks but if you don\\'t like a frothy coffee this isn\\'t for you. You can always scoop out the foam from the coffee but some of it WILL linger.\\n\\nAside from coffee flavors and options it looks beautiful and sleek and hardly takes up space on my counter!\\n\\nAs for the milk frother that comes with it, I have never in my life had such foamy and frothy steamed almond milk! I am beyond impressed! I mean BLOWN AWAY! That one aspect was worth every over paid penny! It will also froth your milk cold for iced drinks\\n\\nAside from coffee options, design and the aeroccino-\\nIt\\'s so easy to use! Pop a pod in and wait! Love it!\\n\\nIt does come with a sampler but it\\'s confusing as hell for what\\'s what. Also, I found if you are a prime member it is worth getting yiur pods through prime. 50 pods for under $45 is a great price. They also have variety packs and if you\\'re prime you get free shipping unlile the nespresso website offers. Lastly- they have a recycling system they walk you through how to set it up but everything is 100% recyclable which is why I chose this product. I heard Keurig is a pain to recycle. And apparently you can reuse the pods with your own espresso/coffee but you have to tamper with them a bit. Some say its as easy as resealing. Hopefully they make a reusable pod soon!This machine works with the Nespresso “Vertuoline” coffee pods.\\n\\nYes it’s true...\\n\\nThis 100% is the closest cup of coffee to being in a French cafe.\\n\\nIt’s a very simple machine for the user, although it is packing some advanced and interesting technology inside.\\n\\nEach coffee pod has a barcode around the perimeter which holds the information that programs the coffee machine based on the style of coffee you’ve chosen to brew, you just inserted the pod, close the lid, and press brew button.\\n\\nI’ve attached a handy chart created by a Reddit user, which shows coffee blends, brew styles, caffeine content, pod color & names.\\n\\nFrom what I understand, the pod is spun at very high speeds (above 10k RPM). My GUESS is the centrifugal forces simulate high brewing pressure while also aerating the coffee and creating a perfect thick crema.\\n\\nI do have a discrepancy with either amazon or the manufacturer.. it seems they have multiple versions of the same model. Varying locations of the De’Longhi and Nespresso logos, and varying chrome accents around the holding tray. Difference only seem aesthetic, but stock photos on listing don’t represent the exact machine customers are receiving.\\n\\nI’ll update the review regarding this discrepancy (if I get to the bottom of it). My initial hunch is either old inventory is being sold OR a new redesigned unit is being sold.\\n\\nI DO prefer the look of unit in the stock (advertised) photos which shows the De’Longhi logo on the top of the machine with the nespresso logo on the bottom and the black tray.\\n\\nRegardless, this coffee is the bomb.\\n\\nSome more subjective thoughts..\\n\\nPremium coffee comes at a premium price (relatively speaking based on “pod style” coffee brewing systems) but if you can curb your coffee habits away from those even more expansive options like Starbucks or your local hip coffee bar, this system is FAR cheaper and MUCH MUCH more premium.\\n\\nTime.. yes, it takes valuable time to brew the perfect cup of coffee. About double the amount of time your common Kurig takes, that’s over a solid minute sometimes.\\n\\nPod availability & purchasing convenience.. I get my Vertuoline pods either online or at Macy’s. That’s it. You can’t just run to wallworld or Costco or really any normal grocer to grab some pods if your low and in a snag. (At least with my experience in central Florida)\\n\\nOverall I’m very happy with this buy, and as (almost) always I got an amazing price on Amazon!I am a huge fan of the original Nespresso capsules and most all of the machines that use the original, smaller capsules. I have been inquisitive about these larger capsules for larger cups of American-style cups of coffee. To get a larger cup of coffee, we very often use two of the original capsules at one time, using a little more water than an espresso calls for. I know that one of the Vertuo capsules is cheaper than two of the Original. Finally gave this Vertuo a try and am a bit disappointed.\\n\\nThe machine works very well: Efficient, quick, fairly quiet, easy to clean and maintain. You push a button and that\\'s it. The crema is very thick, (almost seems like fake crema....). What makes it \"Plus\" and \"Deluxe\" is the fact that you can make both larger cups of coffee and espresso with the push of a single button. Nespresso makes two sizes of Vertuo capsules and this machine reads the label to add the right amount of water.\\n\\nIt\\'s the Vertuo capsule coffee that falls short of my expectations. Out of all the blends that are offered, (I think we tried 16--twelve 8 ounce capsules and four espresso capsules), and I personally only like maybe 3-4 of them. Am I spoiled by the Original Nespresso capsules? Probably so. So beware, if you are used to the Regular Nespresso coffee blends, you may be disappointed in the Vertuo blends, too. Plus, there are many more blends and flavors to choose from in the Regular line.From the moment I took this out of the box, I knew that it was something special. The coffee maker itself looks sleek and beautiful. It looks and performs like the espresso machine from the future. It is black with chrome accents and has a very expensive, luxury look. The capsule lid is motorized and works with one touch. It is very smooth, quiet, and flawless. After the coffee is made the empty capsule is delivered into a bin on the back for easy removal. The water tank swivels so that you can make it fit to your particular cabinet or shelf situation. The drip tray can be adjusted to fit different heights of coffee cups or accommodate a short espresso cup. We have large coffee mugs, and they were right up against the machine. Regular size cups would work perfect. The “Milk Frother” is 5-star. The set up comes with a starter kit of different coffees and they are very good. Of course we like the stronger ones. It is not a coffee maker that we can use on a daily basis but on the weekends, we really enjoy making a specialty coffee with the froth on top. The capsules, I think, are very expensive and have to be ordered online. That is another reason that we would not use this luxury coffee maker every day.\\n\\nPlease Note: Nespresso has two different capsules. Depending upon which machine you have is which capsule you will need. The “original” and the “VertuoLine”. This machine uses the “VertuoLine” capsules. It will NOT use the “original” line. The “original” capsules can be found in many places including some “big-box” stores. I have yet to find the “VertuoLine” capsules anywhere other than online. Many different companies offer “compatible” “original” capsules. . . . Not so with the “VertuoLine” capsules, or at least not yet. I think one of the reasons is that the “VertuoLine” capsules have a barcode around the edge. I’m sure that Nespresso wanted to try and stop all the other companies from making money off their machines, so they made a new capsule that can’t be duplicated (or at least not yet).\\n\\nOne more thing. . . De’Longhi makes a lot of different coffee machines. Many of them are the more “fancy” sort of machines where you can use your own beans. Some of them are a bit pricey. . . Some are more reasonable. But in the end, because you can use your own beans, and don’t have to pay over a buck per-cup (as you do with Nespresso) . . .it can be more affordable even with the higher cost of the machine. But this Nespresso machine certainly makes it easy.We\\'ve had this machine a little over one year and have enjoyed every cup of coffee made with it. We normally make 2-4 cups of coffee a day.\\n\\nUnfortunately it started leaking coffee down the back of the machine just after it went out of warranty. We\\'ve tried descaling it multiple times but no luck on fixing the problem. I then did some searching and found that someone had fixed the problem by removing the rubber/silicone ring in the top that clamps down on the coffee pod, putting some plumbing tape/teflon tape on it and reinstalling the ring. I attempted to remove the ring but found that ours had hardened up and was coming apart as I tried to remove it. The ring never broke in two but would still make a seal so I just stuffed it back up into its slot without ever being able to put any tape on it and thought for sure I would be buying a new machine. I then tried making a cup just to see what would happen and what do you know, no leak.\\n\\nFast forward a few weeks and the original machine has been leak free since then. I suspect the rubber or silicone ring in the top of the unit either compresses from use or hardens up due to pressure and heat and doesn\\'t seal on the pods properly after a lot of usage. It\\'s possible that just pulling that ring down a little a little will fix the problem but I\\'d like to find either an OE or universal ring that would fit.Before I jump into a review, I\\'ll say one thing: I never thought something would supplant my Keurig. Ever.\\n\\nBut the Nespresso VertuoPlus has. And pretty easily.\\n\\nWhile I drink coffee for the energy boost it gives me in the morning as a large reason for doing so, I genuinely enjoy the taste of a good cup of coffee. Keurig brewers, even when using your own fresh ground beans, never really got me close to that. Don\\'t get me wrong; I still think there\\'s a lot of room for a Keurig in a house...in most houses, probably. But after the first time I tasted a Nespresso brew, I knew the Keurig and I were breaking up.\\n\\nThe Nespresso VertuoPlus is, in short, a Keurig for people that like better coffee. You pay for it, but overall, I think it\\'s incredibly worth it. The VertuoPlus works almost identically to a Keurig. You pick your pod. Open the machine. Pop it in. And press go. There are, however, some major differences.\\n\\nFor one, the VertuoPlus delivers the amount of water you need based on your pod. There are sensors that figure this out for you, but at our house we just call it coffee magic. The coffee magic determines how much should be poured (there currently three sizes Nespresso offers) and brews your coffee (or espresso) for you within 2-3 minutes, complete with a lovely creama. The Nespresso has a centrifuge system that helps achieve this and also makes the coffee taste pretty phenomenal. Once you\\'re done, the system has a receptacle at the back that will hold your empties, that Nespresso will actually recycle for you for free.\\n\\nThe Nespresso has a few shortcomings, but they all have to do with acquiring their pods. First, they are more expensive than Keurig pods. Where you can get K-cups for .30-60 cents per cup, a Nespresso pod will run you about $1 a piece. If you\\'re willing to pay for better tasting coffee, you\\'re probably willing to spend a little more. The larger issue is availability. Both Amazon and Nespresso offer online services, but it is frustrating sometimes when I can\\'t just run to the grocery to get them.\\n\\nDespite the issue of availability, the VertuoPlus has become my go-to coffee machine when I don\\'t have time to press my own. The machine is reasonably priced, works incredibly well, and brews a very nice cup of joe.\\n\\nHighly RecommendedI was buying 5-6 dollar coffees EVERYDAY and I have had this machine for less than a month and its basically paid for its self. I LOVE it and recommend it to every one I talk to. My wife bought the VertuoPlus with the Frother for me for my birthday and this is by far the best gift I\\'ve received and again in the long run this will save you money. 10 pods in a sleeve for like a dollar a pop, so inexpensive for such delicious coffee. I now no longer have a coffee problem more of a Nespresso problem. I have bought so many sleeves I don\\'t know how long it will take me to drink them all. LolI had this for about one year (approximately one cup per day) until it encountered problems. At one point, it stopped brewing the correct amount and just kept brewing until the entire reservoir was empty. I checked everything but only hit the button one time and nothing changed. To fix this, I decided to descale the machine and did everything the way it was written in the manual. After exiting descaling mode, it continued to have problems brewing the correct size (or brewing at all). I searched online for days - because I do love this coffee. Eventually I found a way to do a factory reset of the machine. That actually fixed the problem... for about 2-3 months. In the last few weeks it started having problems again brewing the incorrect size. Now, the machine won\\'t even turn on (seriously I tried EVERYTHING - including checking my fuse box, resetting the outlet, moving it to another one, etc.). While the machine makes good coffee, it has some serious issues and should last longer than one year (especially for the price). My advice: pass on this and buy a better machine.This is an impressive coffee/espresso maker for the price! I don\\'t think of myself as being mechanically inclined nor a fancy-coffee-maker so I was a little hesitant about ordering this from Vine and being able to set it up quickly and use it. Luckily, Nespresso made it very easy. I took it out of the box right away, read the instructions for about 5 minutes, and started setting it up. Within 20 minutes (after doing a rinse cycle, per the directions, I was already making a frothy cup of coffee, easily following the directions in the booklet with minimal frustration.\\n\\nInstead of doing an all new review, a few take-aways, building off of others\\' comments:\\n\\n*I found the water reservoir to be relatively convenient. By being off to the side, I was able to put it a little farther back on our counter, which is great for our very limited counter space.\\n*This does fill to the very top of our mugs on a normal pour. I do like cream in my coffee, especially the frothed milk with the handy frother. A simple fix was to press the button once when I wanted it to stop early. I was then easily able to accommodate the cream/frothed milk.\\n*The coffee pods are pretty expensive, which kind of nixes this as our everyday coffee maker. We will likely kick this one out on weekends and/or long holidays. We are teachers so we have some long holidays where it would be worth lugging it in and out of the garage to use it for a couple weeks or even a couple months during our summer break. We will continue to use our regular coffee maker for our every-day coffee. The pods come out to about 75 cents each- cheaper than a Starbucks, for sure, but too much for a regular cup. For those that like to visit a coffee shop every day, it may be worth getting the pods for every-day use.\\n\\nThe milk frother is very easy to use and takes little time to set up and clean. I do not like to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning, so this is a must for me.\\n\\nThe coffees are excellent and Nespresso does a good job of describing each in the included variety pack, especially along the intensity scale. My husband and I were able to find several coffees that we are happily ordering again for those weekend/holiday coffees.\\n\\nThis is an excellent wedding/new house gift, or just a self-indulgent splurge.Yes, I know it\\'s expensive. Yes, I know the pods aren\\'t readily available.\\nBut if you love coffee (and I was born with a cappuccino ladle in my mouth), this is an incredible machine!\\nIt\\'s very easy to use--after the first cleaning operation which lasts a few minutes--select a pod, touch the tab and up the top goes exposing a receptacle for that pod. Slip it in, touch the tab downwards and it\\'s ready to go. I really like how fast the water gets heated so that it is ready to make a cup very quickly, certainly under a minute. This is really, really good coffee and you can tell this as the aroma hits your nose as it\\'s brewed. One thing to be careful of, my machine does not reliably eject the used pod so watch for that. Before slipping in a new pod, the old should hit the used pod receptacle at the back of the machine with a soft thunk. If you don\\'t hear that, it won\\'t close on the new pod, stopping with a red light error condition. What has worked is to press the tab up again and it\\'ll properly eject the pod.\\nMost of the pods in the welcome pack I can do without although for testing purposes I tried them out. I\\'m not a fan of decaffeinated coffee but even those tasted good. The head/crema on the coffee in the cup is glowing and sumptuous. Add some milk to that from the included milk frother and you\\'re in heaven. The frother, or the Aeroccino 3 to call it by its proper name, uses some kind of magnetic levitation to whisk milk into a foam that is solid and won\\'t break apart. This is real coffee house stuff here.\\nThere\\'s just nothing I don\\'t like about this machine and if the pods were readily available and reasonably priced, this would garner an easy 10 stars. As it is, I\\'m going to have to settle for the 5. If you\\'re a coffee fiend, you\\'re going to get this machine, period.Bought this coffee machine for the adjustable water tank. The power cord underneath is not as flexible as I expected, when the tank is at left or right. The cord is accessible below the tank (when at left or right) at one position that limited placement of the machine. The machine works well, but the design of power cord could be better. Called Nespresso, said it\\'s their standard design. Love the frother.I have an unhealthy obsession with coffee, so was excited to try out this machine! The machine was simple to set up. Just stick the water reservoir on, swivel the water reservoir to the desired position, and run several cups of water through the machine to clean out any debris. Cleaning the machine is a somewhat animated activity. All you need to do is fill the reservoir and the machine does the rest.\\nThis machine can make either regular coffee or Expresso. There are two different size capsules to use. The larger capsules are for coffee and the smaller is for brewing Expresso. All drinks are brewed with around a fourth of an inch of foam or creme on top. I don\\'t believe there is a way to eliminate the foam, if that is not your thing.\\nThe coffees from the variety pack are displayed beautifully and seem to be all full bodied. If you are a fan of Keurig coffee, this may not be the cup of coffee for you. It definitely does not have that watered down taste!\\n\\nThe pods are a bit difficult to come by. Some specialty stores sell them, but Amazon of course is a good choice. The pods average around $1 a piece, which is still cheaper then a artisan coffee from your local coffee shop.\\nOne feature I am absolutely in love with on this machine is, the top off function. The machine is programmed to make 8 oz cups of coffee, but if you prefer a bit larger cup of coffee, you can push the Brew button at the end of brewing and the machine will keep going. A second cool feature this machine offers is, that it disposes used pods on its own into a receptacle in the machine. This saves you from having to constantly take single trips to the trash to get rid of your old capsule.\\nOverall, this is a fantastic machine that quickly makes coffee shop quality coffee. If you are a high end coffee addict, this may be the machine for you. I can\\'t wait what else they come up with in the future!Although it’s a Good coffee maker but first one broke 3 months into use , second one lasted 4 months only ( we use it twice daily only ) so averages 300 cups of coffee each before they just stop working, with the price of pods that’s most expensive cups of coffee you can have .Quiero comprar una igual pero con la indicación de voltaje que la debo conectar.\\nEnviamela lo antes posible por favor.\\nMe lo confirma vía email y se hace pago con lo pagado por la anterior.\\n\\nGraciasWe\\'ve never had an espresso maker before, so this was a learning experience for us. The unit was very nicely packed, and the instruction manual made assembly easy. The only thing that confused me was opening the top, where the capsules are inserted. As it turns out, it opens and closes via an electric motor, so of course it won\\'t work unless it\\'s plugged in. Also, the little attachment that goes in the bottom of the frother is very small - much smaller than I expected - so I spent some time looking for some larger attachment in the box.\\n\\nOnce assembled, you need to run it through an auto-clean cycle, which the instruction manual will walk you through. After that\\'s done it\\'s time to make coffee. It comes with about a dozen capsules, each a different flavor. This selection doesn\\'t cover the entire line of flavors available from Nespresso, but I think there are only about four that are left out. It\\'s very easy to use, just put some water in the jug which attaches to the side, press up on the lever on the front to open the top (which will automatically eject any old capsules and drop them in the bin on the back), and drop your new coffee capsule into the holder. Close that, place a cup on the holder on the front, press the start button on top and wait just a couple of minutes for your coffee to be dispensed. At the same time, you can put a bit of milk into the frother and let that run - it should be done in plenty of time for your coffee.\\n\\nWe\\'ve sampled quite a few flavors from those provided, and quite simply love them. They are strong of course - that\\'s why you add the cream from the frother. My only complaint is that this brand of capsules is not available in any of our local stores, so you\\'ll have to order them from Amazon. I don\\'t mind the price too much, it\\'s certainly much less expensive than going to a coffee house, but of course much more expensive than making ordinary coffee.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s a beautiful machine, it works quickly and the espresso is delicious. Cleaning is very easy as well. It\\'s a wonderful addition to our kitchen and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced machine for their home.This does everything it notes. The Nespreso obviously won\\'t give the flavor of a well-poured, freshly mixed brew but it\\'s OK for large groups, for people who use milk and sugar anyway, or for those who prefer flavored coffees.\\nTaste aside, my main concern is the same as for other similar coffee makers, and that\\'s how the heating apparatus can clog with mineral sediment (and bacteria) fairly regularly (coffee is a good medium for this). I\\'d clean it out with lemon juice or dilute vinegar (or your own favorite cleaner) followed by a couple of water rinses now and then, and I would suggest doing this before you brew your first cup (it\\'s manufactured in the usual place, so product safety should be a consideration).\\nThis is a capsule-type machine, so you are sort of locked in to buying more of the manufacturer\\'s capsules. I haven\\'t tried to rig the machine so you can re-use your capsules with a favorite blend. The company does provide a bag to mail in used containers if you think the plastic bag, and the fuel used to mail it with, are sound trade-offs. If you don\\'t use the machine frequently, you may consider that coffee has a rather short unrefrigerated shelf-life unless you use preservatives. Also, keep in mind that your ecological footprint will be somewhat larger with a capsule machine, if that matters to you.I\\'ve never owned a coffee maker, and to be honest, I\\'ve never wanted one. I like my Starbucks. But there are some Saturday and Sunday mornings that I just don\\'t want to get out of bed and go get coffee ... And I have to have my coffee. Sure, I could send my husband, but when I do that, I have to order off the menu and it costs more money. When the opportunity arose to get the VertuoPlus, I could hardly contain my glee - it makes espresso! That\\'s what I drink from Starbucks! It came with the Aeroccino 3 milk frother! I only make iced coffee drinks, but still - maybe one day I\\'ll want a cup of hot coffee. Imagine my surprise to learn that the Aeroccino 3 does hot AND cold frothing! The machine is very simple to use, starting with a hot water rinse prior to brewing your first delicious cup. There aren\\'t a lot of buttons or settings or things to fuss over - you just pop the pod into the machine, push a button, pour your milk or cream into the Aeroccino 3, push a button, and about a minute later you have a beautiful cup of coffee and a beautiful, foamy hot or cold milk to add in. As for the flavors, I have tried three of the pods that came in my sampler box, which I made all iced and with almond milk. I didn\\'t really care for any of the coffees ... When Monday came back around and it was time to head to Starbucks, I told myself that surely my espresso would taste better with the almond milk than the Nespresso coffee had been. I was wrong. Apparently almond milk renders all coffee teetering on the brink of undrinkable. Now I have a pint of Half & Half in my fridge at home and the almond milk has been repurposed to make my breakfast. I could go on forever about how amazing and wonderful this coffee maker is, but I have a lot of work to do so I\\'m going to leave you with this: I truly believe it is a purchase you will not regret.Super easy to use and the flavors are amazing. We would frequent our local coffee house and would spend about $6 per drink, this is a do it at home, make it the way you want for way less the price. Get a frother and you can make your own foam or flavors to customize.As for the coffee this machine makes it\\'s pretty good for the most part. So far I\\'ve only tried the few samples that came with it. About a third of them I didn\\'t care for at all. And that\\'s not all that I don\\'t like about it. The bad part of having this machine is the capsules for it are very expensive and I haven\\'t been able to find them at any store around here or anyplace other than on Amazon and they are suppose to be available on the special Nespresso Club website. Haven\\'t got around to checking that out yet. The biggest fault of this machine is it uses only the special coffee pods or capsules that are made just for this machine. They start at $11 for 10 of the same kind and the price quickly goes up from there. I\\'ve seen some for $22.50 for 10 and up to $45.00 for only 10. I don\\'t know about anyone else but $4.50 for a cup of coffee is way too much for me. For me to pay that much for coffee it better be in a 24oz mug and taste so gooood that it can almost give me an orgasm, and a all day high! Now if the pods for it were a competitive price with all the other Nespresso pods that don\\'t work with this machine, like under $1 each and several at .50¢ each and available at Walmart, King Soopers, Safeway, and other stores I would give this machine a 5 * rating.\\nThe machine itself works pretty good. Except mine leaked a big puddle of water on my counter the first time I used it. It\\'s very simple to use. Just make sure you put water in the holding tank, press up on the lever on the front and the motor drive opens it. Drop a pod in it, press down on the little lever and it closes with the motor drive. Wait for the green light on top to stay on then lightly press the little button with the green light. Make sure your cup is under the spout on the front first though. It does its thing and fills your cup with coffee. It only takes a couple of minutes to brew any cup of coffee that you have the pods for with little to no fuss no mess. Cept maybe some water on the counter. It\\'s too bad that the special coffee pods for it are so expensive and are only available by ordering them online then have to wait for the mail to get them to you.\\nI did find a kit on Amazon that you can use to reuse the pods with your own coffee. I ordered one of them so that I can use my own favorite brand of coffee and maybe try some beans and grind my own coffee to make my own pods.\\nUPDATE\\nI\\'m now more familiar with my machine and I\\'m tempted to change my rating to just one star. First, the problem with this thing leaking water all over the counter is worse than I thought it was. This thing leaks all the time that it still has water in the tank! Ignore it long enough and it will leak the whole container of water out onto the counter. The other problem is with the coffee pods. About 1 out of 10 the machine will reject. Put the pod in, set my mug under the spout, close the top and press the little button, light flashes green a couple of times, then goes red and shuts off. No idea why it didn\\'t finish the cycle. Put another pod in it and it works fine. Any where from 6 pods to 12 pods later and it does it again. It rejects at least 1 to 2 pods out of every ten and that\\'s just throwing money away.\\nOnce I use up the pods I have left this thing is going back in it\\'s box and going out to the shed where I store all the other things that I have that don\\'t work like they are suppose to. Then I\\'m going to take the money that I would have wasted on pods for the reject and buy a new Mr Coffee machine for good old regular coffee.I love the coffee this makes, the creme really adds to the flavor. I love the coffee, but the machine is not robust. It has plugged on me and had to refer to online manual to figure out descaling. Then the lid would not open, and there is no way to manually open it. Had to send it in. Although the customer service is great, I would rather not have to use it. Can\\'t wait to get the machine back for the great coffee, but would like a more bullet proof machine.There is nothing wrong with my machine. It works as advertised, very well. Further, I have found the company\\'s customer service doing their best to be helpful and respectful.\\n\\nBut based upon the fact that I was a part owner of a coffee shop in Oregon, I have some experience with espressos, single origin and blended coffees. My issues are these:\\n1.) There is very little distinction in flavor between Nespresso\\'s espresso pods. The same is true with their coffee pods.\\n2.) Every single pod consistently spews out foam. For some drinks, foam is appropriate. For an Americano? No. For a basic cup of coffee? Blech!There is a lot to like with the Nespresso Vertuo Plus Deluxe Coffee and Expresso Machine.\\nThe set up is simple but make sure to read the directions because the first step is to prep/clean the machine. Also, make sure you use a light touch for the off/open /close lever.\\nI\\'ve been using the Nespresso machine for a few weeks and I love it. It sure beats going to Starbucks!\\nThe coffee tastes so smooth, creamy and overall delicious.\\n\"Nespresso VertuoLine Coffees are characterized by rich, generous foam called crema - naturally formed during the brewing process, thanks to our new Centrifusion™ technology. The unique centrifuge action of the Nespresso VertuoLine ensures you get every drop of flavor from each Nespresso capsule. Just insert a capsule and close the lever, when activated, the capsule spins up to 7,000 rotations per minute, blending ground Coffee with hot water and producing the perfect crema to complement your favorite Coffee or Espresso.\"\\nIt only takes a few minutes and my morning coffee has me ready to go!\\nI love the water canister that holds enough water for several uses (64 oz.)\\nThe Nespresso reads each capsule so it knows exactly what to do. I did buy a separate milk frother so I could experience the lattes and cappuccinos fully. According to the Nespresso website, adding milk creates a whole new taste sensation, as well as bringing soft, smooth and creamy textures to the coffee.\\nFor an even more indulgent experience, start by pouring about 2 oz (50ml) of milk in your cup and brew your coffee over it. I can definitely taste the creaminess described, Nespresso coffees are a whole new level that you, (IMO), can\\'t compare to K-Cup like coffees.\\nI also like how on the Nespresso website it gives you a breakdown of the different coffee and espresso; their intensity, flavor, and smoothness.\\nNespresso \\'s website has a variety of coffees but the sample pack included gives you a great idea of the diversity of the coffees. When the machine finishes making a cup of coffee it discards the capsule in a collection bin which is convenient. Nespresso also offers to recycle the coffee capsules, you can send the empty capsules in the bag Nespresso supplies but you have to request it.We got this from our registry and after 6 months of use, the machine has completely stopped working. I loved the coffee this machine makes and we have tried absolutely everything from factory resetting to using different outlets. It just completely stopped working. It\\'s a waste of money and you are better off going with a more reliable model. When it worked it was great, but I think the quality of product is very low and I wish I could tell you it was something fixable.I was not prepared for how good this coffee/espresso maker really is. I own and use a Tassimo daily and have used other Nespresso (espresso-only) coffee makers as well as various Keurigs. Hands down this is the best \"pod-based\" coffee maker I\\'ve ever used.\\n\\nThere are a few reasons for this. First, this unit takes pods for both coffee and espresso. The pods have the same base (so they fit the machine), but different sized shells so that they have the right amount and grind of coffee for the drink they are making. The base of the pods has what is essentially bar code that tells the machine how to brew that coffee. Finally, this machine doesn\\'t just force hot water/steam down through the pod (like my Tassimo or a Keurig). Instead, it swirls the hot water/steam around the pods. This creates an insane amount of crema while still giving you a strong coffee or shot of espresso.\\n\\nThe machine is a breeze to set up and use. The holding tray for your cup can be adjusted to the best height you need from a demitasse cup to a large coffee mug. Coffee is dispensed outwards from the machine, so even very large mugs can be used (not so for my Tassimo). The water reservoir is good sized and visible from the front, so it is easy to see when it must be refilled. To open and close the pod holder, just tap the front \"handle\". It is motorized and slides open and shuts at a touch.\\n\\nSome folks mentioned only being able to get pods from Amazon. Target also sells the pods as do some Macys. And of course you can order direct from Nespresso. The only disappointment for me is that you really can only do coffee and espresso. My Tassimo has chocolate, milk, and tea pods as well and we\\'ve found that versatility to be handy at times.\\n\\nFinally, Nespresso has a recycling program for their pods, so you can get a bag for your used pods and send them back, free of charge. I really like that as it eliminates one of the issues with these pod-based machinesAmazing coffee!! So easy and quick i got this for my husband and he loves it definitely a must buySo far I’m very happy with the quality and the amount of effort It takes to make a cup of coffee with this Nespresso machine. My one and only compliant would be: “how incredibly wasteful, and limiting these machines pod business model can be”\\n\\nThe pods can easily become a very expensive habit, especially if you have multiple people using them. They claimed to be recycle pods, but still an awful amount of plastic waste being produced by one person on a daily basis.\\n\\nI ended up buying a third party reusable pod for my machine and so far it has been working great. I’m just a bit disappointed with the fact that Nespresso doesn’t have their own reusable pods yet, if they are truly confident about their products they should have offered the costumer with this option by now...anyways\\n\\nIn summary, this is a great espresso machine for all those coffee fanatics out there, but I highly recommend buying a third party reusable pod. You will save yourself a lot of money and you won’t have to deal with the hassle of ordering Nespresso pods every month.Makes the best cup of coffee and an awesome espresso!!!Pretty nice. Have a different Nespresso model at the office - so this was nice to compare. Nice features, then opening the top, press lever and it opens automatically (other model does not; although it did seem to stick a couple of times, will watch that). The water reserve tank is also nice that it is moveable. I have this unit next to my Keurig, and it does not take up much room at all because I have the water tank in the back/hidden.\\n\\nThe frothing unit is a big bonus. Easy. And very cool. Actually, you can do hot or cold milk froth (I\\'m using soy milk and it froths nicely); nice, creamy, thick. I start the frothing thing first, then the coffee; they get done about same time. I have it sitting sort of in front/in between the two coffee makers.\\n\\nNow -- for the actual coffee. Have tried a few now -- regular coffee and the expresso. GOOD! I\\'ve added froth topping (hot and cold) to regular coffee/really good. I made express this AM and mixed w/frothed milk for a nice \"expresso latte\". Great. Since the pod/capsules are a little pricy, trying to use regular Keurig days/and Nespresso nights (I like nice cup of coffee at night). Although that morning expresso was really good.\\n\\nAll in all, pretty nice. (but more expensive than Keurig on a regular basis -- and I drink a lot of coffee)My Cuisinart 12-cup Grind and Brew died and decided to get a different brand of coffeemaker. It made decent coffee, but the carafe had a big lip on it that was always spilling coffee. Have a Keurig in the office that makes okay coffee-not as good as Cuisinart but less messy. Decided to try a Nespresso and glad I did as there is a world of difference in taste. Nespresso makes coffee that you savor; can\\'t say that about Cuisinart or Keurig coffee.\\nHowever Nespresso coffee is more expensive than Keurig-approximately $1/pod versus $.50/pod and not as widely available. Also you don\\'t have a choice in amount with Nespresso-you can only make the amount specified by the particular pod versus Keurig where you can choose between small, medium, or large cup per pod.\\nIt really comes down to how important the taste of your coffee is to you. Very important-get a Nespresso and order the pods from their website for the best selection and price. Not important-get a Keurig, Mr. Coffee, Cuisinart, etc.I just bought some nespresso pods on the website. Apparently there is a massive international decaf pod shortage. Maybe the decaf elves need to work faster. This is not my beef.\\n\\nMy beef is that after I order it i have to sign up and log in to website to get a tracking number.\\n\\nChill out nespresso send the pods and the tracking in an email. Thinking you special because of brad pitt? Oh youre special, you\\'re a star even.... 1 star out of 5.First off, I don\\'t use this machine every day. I grind my own coffee beans every morning for a normal pot of coffee, and that is what I drink during the week. But I\\'ve had Nespresso at other people\\'s houses, and I always thought it would be lovely to have for mornings when I\\'m off work, for a weekend, or for a special occasion. I always talked myself out of getting it, though, because of the price of the machine and the price of the pods.\\n\\nI finally decided to get this, though, mostly because it comes packaged with the Aeroccino frother as well, and I\\'m so sorry I didn\\'t just get it sooner. The quality of the Nespresso pods is outstanding. i\\'ve used 75% of the complimentary pods so far, and I haven\\'t had one yet that I didn\\'t like. It will be a challenge to decide which ones to replace when I order more. I have only used the milk frother once so far, but it produced an incredible, silky foam that made me feel like I\\'d spent $5.00 on my drink.\\n\\nI honestly can\\'t imagine using this every single day, because of the price of the pods, but it has worked out the way I expected: I use it almost every Saturday morning to treat myself to a wonderful cup of coffee, and I\\'ve made a handful of lattes and cappuccinos on days off from work.\\n\\nIf you\\'re waffling on whether or not this is worth the price, I think it is, especially with the frother. And even though the Nespresso pods are both pricey and proprietary, the incredible cup of coffee or shot of espresso you get is well worth it. This is not just an expensive Keurig, it\\'s a lovely addition to any home coffee bar.If you love GOOD coffee, any Nespresso coffee setup is for you. Pricewise, you\\'ll save money replacing Starbucks with these $1.10 pods. (That\\'s saving at least half of what a coffee cost at the local cafe.) You\\'ll get crema, coffee in under 2.5 minutes, and 24 flavors to choose from right from the convenience of your home. I\\'m a coffee purist--no milk, sugar, etc. These coffees are really good, but you have to try a lot from the sampler to find the perfect cup for you. The descriptions are helpful.\\n\\nThis entry-level machine is quiet and it doesn\\'t take up that much room. The interface is basic and not overwhelming. Easy 3-stip coffee process is convenient. I can\\'t believe how high quality the coffee is!\\n\\nThere is a lot of technology you don\\'t see in the machine. I hope it never fouls up: lots of codes if it does! [knocking on wood] But this technology and quality bean selection is the reason why it tastes s good. I call it the Dre Beats of coffee makers because I think that THIS is the way coffee was meant to taste like. High quality and pure. I have to limit myself to 2 cups or I\\'d be drinking coffee all day! Mornings are a joy and I look forward to my first cup.\\n\\nSide Note: I\\'m pretty sure Nespresso\\'s machines are made by DeLonghi--this one is despite not having any branding on it (except Nespresso at the top). If you get it on Amazon, it will say DeLonghi. If you get the same machine at the Nespresso store, DeLonghi logo will be replaced by Nespresso.\\n\\nSo far, I can\\'t offer any improvements. I do have one preference they should consider though: a flat plug so it doesn\\'t stick out of the wall (my setup is different).I\\'ll start this review by saying that I found no negatives (outside of coffee pod prices) for the Nespresso VertupPlus Deluxe coffee and espresso maker.\\n\\nFrom the moment I set this up and made my first cup of absolutely silky smooth coffee it was love at first sip. The coffee maker is easy to setup and it warms water in less than 30 seconds. Once you place one of the pods in the machine the motorized lid closes and you hit the button. The Nespresso injects water and swirls it around the coffee until it come out of the spout with a delicious foam. I can\\'t say enough good things about this coffee. It\\'s smooth, and just about every pod (from the sample set) I tried was delicious. Even the decaf is good.\\n\\nThe foamer is an odd duck but it does the job. You pour in milk, although my girlfriend prefers coconut milk, and push the button. There\\'s a small whisk inside that spins as the milk warms up. It creates an excellent foam that nicely complements coffee or espresso.\\n\\nThe one downside is the price of the pods. If you\\'re used to picking up 100 coffee pods from Costco for $40 prepare for a little sticker shock. Each pod costs roughly a dollar and a little change. But honestly, the coffee is so good it\\'s the kind of thing you make once a day as a treat and then use your regular brewer for the rest of your coffee needs.\\n\\nOne last note. I really appreciate the small foot print this coffee maker leaves on a counter. I\\'ve had Kuerigs for years and they are pretty large. This is a slim and sexy machine that would look good in anyone\\'s kitchen.I am not much of a coffee snob, so please take this review for what it\\'s worth. This Nespresso machine is amazing. I even love how chic the little pods are. It was so easy to set up and I had a perfectly hot cup of coffee within a minute of plugging it in. I like how you can move the water container around the machine to suit your space. Having said that, I do think the size is a little cumbersome, and that is probably because of the water tank. Even when moved to either side or the back, it is still kind of bulky for my kitchen (I don\\'t have a ton of counter space). Note: After refilling the water tank, simply set it on the base where it rests. Do not twist it after setting it down. My husband set it down on the base and twisted it, and water leaked. Just FYI. It didn\\'t happen again after the twisting incident. This coffee maker is the pinnacle of coffee makers. I tried all of the pods provided and re-ordered the hazelnut pods as I like those best.\\n\\nAs much as I love the Nespresso machine, I LOVE the Aeroccino. It is amazing. Makes perfect foamed milk at the perfect temperature in about a minute. And it\\'s so quiet! I confess I\\'ve been more into green tea matcha lattes lately, and use this aeroccino every day. It is so cool. I also love how small and compact it is, and it\\'s pretty easy to clean. This has gotten much more use than the Nespresso but I guess I\\'m more of a matcha drinker lately :) All around this is a beautiful, superbly featured set and I would recommend it to all coffee lovers.I love having this machine in our office. There are very few single cup coffee makers that are sleeker or better looking than this one. One touch loading of the pods, a nice and automatic emptying of the pods into a separate container. Easy fill and load on the water.\\n\\nBest of all, the coffee is excellent. Rich and flavorful, much more so than the sad cups spat out by the average Keurig.\\n\\nThe only downside? The pods aren\\'t cheap (in and around a buck a cup). Cheaper than Starbucks, but not by much. But good coffee, quick and easy.\\n\\nEdit: Our office has continued to have a problem of water leakage when loading and removing the water canister. No matter how careful we are it seems to put a quarter cup of water on the counter every time. Not a tragedy by any extent, but something that would drive me much more insane in my own home.This machine makes a great cup of coffee, however the only brand of coffee found in stores is Starbucks.\\nAnd the only size option is 7oz. Who only drinks 7oz of coffee?? At least Keurig gives you 10oz.\\nThey advertised a 14oz option when I bought it, but that turned out to be false.Nêspresso completely reimagined their machines and created a new pod that makes slightly better espresso but missed every opportunity to improve on the intrinsic flaws of the old machine. Creating a profit driver that is essentially a middle finger to its customers and the environment.\\n\\nDid they fix the massive wastefulness to the environment and use recyclable materials or sustainable materials? No.\\n\\nDid they make a coffee machine that provides a superior value to their customers with this latest iteration? No.\\n\\nThey created a machine that drives profits by making it impossible to use pods manufactured by other companies. Each pod is more than a dollar.\\n\\nAfter seeing the environmental impact Nêspresso’s goal should have been to lessen the impact of disposed pods.\\n\\nHere’s my middle finger back to you nespresso. These kind of business decisions that worsen your customer experience will be your eventual ruin.My husband and I are avid coffee drinkers (aka we are coffee snobs) and wanted a single serve espresso maker that did not take up the entire counter. We live in a state that makes fresh roasted beans and feel that the baristas at most coffee houses burn the espresso or serve stale coffee… we never understood and still do not understand why people actively stand in long lines and pay $5.00 to $8.00 for crap coffee. We also do not have a whole lot of time in the morning to make a proper French press, etc. before work. For this reason, Nespresso works wonderfully.\\n\\nPROS: The crema that this maker leaves is wonderful. (Tasty, rich and thick.), the coffee tastes fresh and crisp, Easy to use (a couple of slight pushes and bam! – you have coffee or an espresso in a minute), time-saver, easy to clean (each pod slides into a single compartment and you dispose all of them at once), size, speed, a versatile selection of pods, super quiet and doesn’t wake the kids in the morning, assembly (open up super cute well-packed box, gently clean things down, add water to compartment- you will have coffee in 5). Machine comes with a variety of pods to try. CONS: The pods are expensive (but only if you compare it to a Keurig), but still cheaper than if we ran to the corner coffeehouse. Average cost of pod ($1.10 per pod) versus Average cost of coffee or Doppio at coffee house ($2.00). You will not be able to find the pods just anywhere... You will have to go to a specialty store or order online.I received this in exchange for an honest review. It\\'s a beautiful machine and looks luxurious. Love the capsule lid which opens and closes with a touch. The drip tray is adjustable, which I like, so it can accommodate different size cups or mugs, and the water tank is roomy. The machine features a container on the back into which the empty coffee pod is emptied - wonderful idea. The frother is a really great bonus although it\\'s a machine unto itself and has to be plugged into an outlet, so if you\\'re limited in that regard, it could be a problem. This comes with a sample pack for both the frother and coffee maker, from decaffeinated to flavored coffees, which allows the consumer to try different ones. It\\'s a bit pricey and you have to buy the pods (you can make them yourself using a product here at Amazon), but all in all, this is a lovely machine, very showy and attractive.I love this Nespresso machine so much that this is my 2nd one. The first is at our 2nd home, and we have really enjoyed it, no complaints at all. I decided to buy one for our primary home because our other pod coffee maker just didn’t make good coffee, so I bought another Nespresso Vertuo, but this one is red ( favorite color ). For whatever reason this new machine’s coffee temperature is not as hot as it should be, especially if you add any milk or cream. I called Nespresso to see if there is any factory settings that can be adjusted, but was told that the only thing I can do is to heat my cup up first, or heat my milk before adding it to the coffee. Very disappointing because we don’t have this issue with our other Nespresso Vertuo. Design flaw, for sure.I am still discovering how to customize this machine, but the default settings produce a pretty nice cup. I like americanos, so I usually top off the water a bit. Today I wanted to just get some hot water out of it & found that this isn\\'t a feature. I recovered a used \"pod\", cut the foil top off & cleaned out the spent grounds. This empty pod can be placed in the machine & hot water will be dispensed when the button in depressed. You may want to remove the container that receives the used pods, so you can save the empty pod for the future. Overall, I thin this machine is going to work for me & hopefully the availability of the pods will continue to increase. This unit should last longer than the ones that use a pump.Coffee maker works fine. It\\'s appearance is nice on the counter, too. When selecting this item from Vine, I thought it was a coffee/expresso maker that used regular coffee. Unlike others, I think $1.10 for a cup of coffee at home is expensive. Of course, I don\\'t buy expensive take out coffee, so I can see the difference of opinions in the costs of the cup of coffee. I can make a whole pot of fresh coffee with my other coffee maker for less than that. If you want the convenience of a fresh cup of coffee or expresso, one at time and don\\'t mind the high price of pods, then this is the coffee maker for you.Your average cup of coffee doesn\\'t taste so great compared to real coffee. I never really liked coffee, especially black coffee. Then I traveled overseas and had black coffee at a café where the beans are picked right out back. Holy cow, I was introduced to what real coffee is supposed to be like. Ever since I have been looking for the same experience. I now know that you have to make investments in order to know what you are getting. Good coffee will cost more than the average. Furthermore, the next step is processing what you get to make sure you get the most out of it. I\\'m no expert in anything coffee, other than liking a certain taste. I don\\'t know how these machines work. I just know the Nespresso by De\\'Longhi works and works well. An easy process to get your coffee made. The only downside of course is the cost of the pods. So very nice that you can get 5 brew sizes. Doubly nice you can move the water tank around to fit counter spacing.I bought my unit about 3 years ago for the NESPRESSO vertuo capsules!\\n\\nI use to go to Starbucks nearly daily to get a double shot espresso black over ice for $8!!!\\n\\nNow that I have this machine I\\'m addicted to the Double Shot Espresso Scuro its $1 a pod.\\nIt tastes like a chocolate vanilla and I can drink a double shot a day every day of the week for $7 as opposed to Starbucks were I\\'d spend about $56.\\n\\nMy favorite coffee flavor is Mexico.\\n\\nAnd my favorite limited edition flavors are -\\nPumpkin spice cake, Italia Black espresso, Australian white over ice.\\n\\nThe limited edition flavors are available online and in store... I don\\'t have a store near me in 50 miles so.... I order on the nespresso site and they give me free samples of coffee I never had before too!\\n\\nI own this machine for 3 years and no issues.\\nAnd I own the Delonghi Evoluo for 2 years and then I have a classic nespresso maker as well but I like the taste of the vertuo better.\\n\\nNote after reading few of these bad reviews these people either don\\'t like coffee or improperly using the machine is how they killed it.This would have been a great machine if it hadn’t stopped working in less than 2 months of use. Cannot get it to work. Don’t waste your money. You’ll end up having to buy parts or buying a totally new machine.First things first, up front disclosures, I received this as part of the Amazon Vine program. Also I am a long time Keurig user and coffee drinker,.\\n\\nI was intrigued by this Nespresso offer, and overall this has exceeded my expectations. I like the quick heat up along with the simple to use controls. The coffee itself is rich and flavorful and there is a wide variety of flavors to choose from. The included milk frother does a fantastic job and is very easy to use. I believe this is a quality product and has been producing some very good coffee for a couple months now.-1 star for being flustered by the top being automatic rather than manual; it sometimes takes a couple of tries to open or close the thing.\\n\\nOtherwise it has been working like a champ. I\\'ve brewed 1.5 oz to 14 oz cups, all seem to taste like coffee. The espresso shots are a bit mild, even the 11 Diavolitto. Not bad, but not knock your socks off flavorful, either.\\n\\nWith the flavors available on Amazon, you get a good 7 oz cup of coffee for just over a buck.Great product and easy to use.I had this machine for 6 months and it started out making amazing coffee. Then all of the sudden I noticed my coffee cups were not getting filled up like they used to and noticed puddling around my coffee maker. I ran the descaling process with the solution twice. I used a toothbrush to clean it all out including working the seals as best I could. Nothing worked. I was so happy with it at first but the machine is garbage and as any owner who has had one for a while can tell you it is only a matter of time before it starts leaking again even if you can get the problem fixed. Poor engineering. DO NOT BUY!My husband and I both like that the water does not sit in the coffee maker like other brands. We like the coffee and expresso pods are recycled back if you order from the company directly. It has been great for coffee for the husband and expresso for me. I do wish there were some more flavors in the expresso\\'s but I\\'m happy with what I have found. I really like how it makes iced expresso and does not melt the ice too fast. Easy to clean but descaling is a bit of a chore and needs to be done. We had an issue, after a year, with coffee coming out the back. Called Nespresso and they were so nice and helpful. After eliminating a few things they walked me through descaling and we figured out that was the issue.Firstly, I did not like a single coffee sample that came with Virtuoso. I tried. Goodness KNOWS I tried. So now I am stuck. I have these beautiful machines but no coffee. So I tried Ripple turmeric milk in the frother......Life-Changing. It was so good it made me laugh out loud. Then hot chocolate, same thing. So the frother is my new best friend but where\\'s the coffee? You know dern well that if you scan around Amazon for a bit you are going to find SOMETHING. That is when I found my lifesaver: Recaps. Little self-adhesive foils that fit over the Virtuoso capsules. I have been re-using the same capsule since last November and it always works the same. I bought some marked-down espresso coffee from Marshall\\'s and I\\'m still stunned how much I like it. P.S. Oatmilk froths up better than cow or almond milk.\\nI love these machines every day because, honestly, I am deserving.I first sampled Nespresso in a Sur La Table store. It was like nothing I had ever had before in a coffee shop and thought it would be awesome to have my own machine, despite its exorbitant price. I finally own one, but I use it as my \"special treat\" coffee, not my everyday coffee. The machine is easy to set up and use. It produces a frothy coffee without milk or cream, which offers a unique spin on the hot beverage. If you want, though, you easily make and add milk froth to the coffee, too, giving it even more airiness and flavor. Where Nespresso gets you is that you have to buy their \"Nespresso capsules,\" which are like Keurig\\'s K-cups, but not exactly. This coffee/espresso maker comes with a sample pack, but you can buy more capsules from Nespresso\\'s website and get a deal if you buy in bulk. That\\'s why this isn\\'t my everyday coffee; I drink about 3 cups every morning and would go through the capsules like crazy.\\n\\nFor the design, I\\'d knock off half a star in my rating. The machine itself is plastic, which seems a little cheap for the price, and the water tank hooked on the back makes it look and feel like an afterthought. I would have liked a machine that looked a bit nicer sitting on my counter.The Nespresso is great! While the Keurig is a great for a standard cup of joe he Nespresso is great for fun signature drinks.\\n\\nNotes\\n- Makes your drink quickly in under a minute\\n- Decent size reservoir we fill ours every few days\\n- Our favorite drinks are the caramel and the Giorno. These are much stronger than anything we can make with our Keurig.\\n- On a per drink basis, it really isn\\'t too expensive. They are about a buck per drink if you buy the pods on Amazon\\n- Upcoming is pretty minimal - but we find that it tastes best with filtered water\\n- We use the frother on occasion and it works well\\n\\nFinal Verdict - a great option for anyone who enjoys gourmet coffees!Purchased this a couple days ago at a Nespresso boutique. Prices were $199 which is almost twice as much. Nespresso stands behind their product and price matched without hesitation. Way to go Nespresso!\\n\\nBrought it home and tried out the samples. Wow, I now feel I’m being served by a barista. Crema was beautiful and lots of flavour.\\n\\nFast forward to today, yes I tried what everyone is talking about. I reused one of the Melozio Nespresso pods and filled it with my LavAzza and replaced the top with Reynolds wrap foil. Just make sure not to cover the bar code. Coffee came out perfect with lots of crema. Pics here are of my LavAzza reusing Nespresso pod. You can enjoy the best of both worlds. Nespresso pods or use your favorite coffee or espresso of choice. It was so easy.Love the coffee from this machine. It is now leaking around the coffee pod. No one can service it locally and no reply from Nespresso. If you buy it, you will get good expensive coffee for less than 12 monthsI already own a Nespresso \"standard\" VertuoPlus coffeemaker, which has gotten passed down to one of my sons. This \"deluxe\" edition is identical to the twenty dollar cheaper regular edition except for: 1) the water tank is larger and 2) the cup stand and a few other parts of the machine are chromed metal instead of plastic.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve never had Nespresso coffee, you are in for a treat. Most coffee makers use some variation of pouring hot water over coffee grounds. The Nespresso utilizes a new way of making coffee by putting the coffee in a miniature centrifuge to force hot water through the coffee under pressure. The result is a rich coffee with a flavorful crema that is the equal or better to any espresso you\\'ve ever tasted. It is super easy to use and quiet and actually is smaller than my Keurig. There is one significant drawback: the pods are only sold by Nespresso, are limited in availability, and cost two to three times more per serving than Keurig. However, if coffee is your passion, then I think you will agree the Nespresso is worth the extra cost.I love this coffee maker. I\\'m kind of nuts about it. I brought it to work at my new job because my French boss uses a Nespresso in the office and I thought maybe we could use another. We have a  Starbucks Verismo 580 Brewer Silver (011023256)  at home and I didn\\'t think we would want to switch but I didn\\'t realize that this Nespresso VertuoPlus uses a different, larger pod than a conventional \"classic\" Nespresso. I\\'ve already ordered an additional 180 pods for this machine. I think it makes better coffee than Verismo and of course it\\'s better than a Keurig.\\n\\nThe machine reads a bar code on each capsule and can be \"taught\" to make the same size cup given a specific sized pod. This is a really great feature as a frustration I have with the Starbucks Verismo is that I have to press additional buttons to incrementally fill my cup (I know this sounds ridiculous but when you are trying to make a cup of coffee while running around getting ready for work its annoying to have to keep returning to the machine to add more coffee to your cup).\\n\\nIt makes a very frothy cup of coffee.Didn’t come with all the products that were listed, nespresso pods and manual. I tried using nespresso pods that I already owned and it didn’t work. Don’t waste your money.Have had keurig for years but I love espresso so I looked into getting this machine. I’ve had it for over a year now and never really use my keurig anymore, sorry keurig. Not only does vertuoplus make espresso but it makes coffee too! All of them are really good and it’s so easy to use. Push the lever to put in pod, it automatically closes and opens, and then push button to brew. It’s an awesome machine and you can order the coffees through Nespresso app and they aren’t expensive. I recommend this machine to any coffee lover. It’ll change the way you drink coffee at home.\\nCheers! This machine is a life changer, and very easy to use and refill/clean. I use every day and it worth the purchase.I got this as a gift, with the Aeroccino, and I couldn\\'t be happier. The milk frother is easy, fast, and perfect for any kind of frothing I want to do. Frothed milk is a treat and enables me to omit the sweetener from my coffee. I use the coffee pods as a special treat, not as my everyday coffee, mainly to remind me of a vacation in Paris. The machine is easy to set up, use, and flush. I haven\\'t had any problems with it (yet?). The VertuoPlus is a bit big, so be mindful of that if you have a small kitchen or small space.What I noticed was that this machine leaks a lot when you put coffee pods into it but does not leak with espresso pods. I do not know what it might be but it is manageable for now and the coffee is too good to switch machines. I decided to create a backside drain area for the leak when drinking coffee and it drains straight into the container I used. I hate to have to resort to this but for now, I will just have to manage it since it is not getting fixed. I hope they will work on this bug, for now, I don\\'t mind just using the espresso pods so I don\\'t have to worry about the leaks. It can be manageable though if you try.SO easy to use. I use it everyday and I love it!!Sleek designINCREDIBLE AEROCCINO! The Foamer is out of this world! This is one coffee accessory I can’t live without! This Foamer whips up a heavenly , fluffy, creamy foam that is so perfect . There’s no way I could ever have a cup of coffee at home again without it!\\nI just can’t say enough about it. Easy to clean with just a rinse. Light and easy to hold with one hand.My first modern non-traditional coffee maker. Generally works fine. I\\'m not a heavy drinker. They say the coffee is better than with other systems, I don\\'t know... many people think so. I usually add vanilla flavoring to my coffee anyway. The Vanizio on its own wasn\\'t enough for me.\\nCoffee will cost more than other systems that accept third party coffees, unless you re-use the coffee packets with the bar codes, which you can get supplies for, but kind of a hassle if you want a quick fix.\\n\\nMy biggest complaints with this model:\\n1) The cup support/holder/platform is too small in my opinion. Some may not care, but I don\\'t like the base of my cup sticking out over the edge of the support. Sure it\\'s works out ok, but it still bothers me.\\n2) The coffee dispenser is too close to the lip of the cup. It hasn\\'t been an issue yet, but I just don\\'t like the design. You might expect a liquid dispenser of any drink system to allow more room for the liquid to come out closer to the center of the cup.\\n\\nI can\\'t speak to to how the design compares with the other coffee systems, this was just supposed to be the latest Nespresso design so I went with it. Could have been a little better despite the benefits mentioned elsewhere (hotter than older systems, etc.).I should give this one star because I was recently trying to drink less coffee. Instead, I have to give it five stars because the coffee is so good that I’m drinking more coffee than I’ve ever drank in my life. It is a completely different and superior coffee experience compared to anything else I’ve tried. I no longer need trips to Starbucks. The coffee has so much flavor and comes out frothy and creamy. This takes homemade coffee to another level.Wow, this thing makes some darn good coffee. It\\'s way better than my other machine, which was given to Goodwill just in case you want to know. Unfortunately my roommate Brandon was burned from his stomach to his genitalia after I scared him while wearing a spooky witch hat, but that tells me that it\\'s nice and hot. I honestly can\\'t wait for winter. It will really warm me up! Five Stars!I love this thing. I have had a keurig before and I have never been able to drink keurig coffee black. It always needed some extra help to taste good. Not this! The coffees made for this machine are great quality. I sometimes add frothed milk with any of the pods and nothing else. So smooth and tasty. Makes me appreciate REAL coffee and espresso. Due to the barcode system on the pods, it may never have third parties creating pods for the machine so as long as you get over the fact that you can only get Nespresso pods, you will love this machine. Worth the price for the quality.My husband brought this in to his classroom, and has been using it for the last six months. (We wanted to wait for him to use it a lot before writing a review.) This Nespresso makes excellent coffee! Our previous experience using pod-based-machines were with machines that use K-cups, but the Nespresso pods make a much stronger brew that is more comparable to what we get with our Jura machine at home.\\n\\nThe downside is that the pods are expensive, but there are lots of flavor/brew options to choose from.The Nespresso VertuoPlus pods will get you attractive, but fairly average tasting coffee - for a pod. It\\'s obviously nothing like a real espresso, but it\\'s certainly convenient. The milk frother is the same as Nespresso has been making for a while - good for making some relatively thick foam.Love my Nespresso so much! My family enjoys coffee and we use it daily. The frother is easy to use hot or cold. I usually make a cup and froth my milk then pour everything over ice. Best investment! I even got my mother in law one and she loves itNespresso vertualino Plus is a good looking machine. Easy to use and clean. The espresso quality is very good, the crema is high quality and abundant for a smooth cup every time. Don’t get me wrong this can make a cup of espresso that will keep you up for hours.Received this as a gift last Christmas, after almost a year of using I finally decided to give it up. It makes good coffee, easy to use, fast brewing, relatively compact. But the pods are too expensive. I roughly went through 500 pods this year and average down they cost well over $1 per coffee, there are cheap ones like 85 cents, but the choices are limited and you have to buy 50 pods per time.\\n\\nSo this one year I spent $169 + $550 = $719. I bought a Breville 870 for my father last year, which was $500, and he probably only spent $100 on beans for the past year, not to mention he also has way more choices and can also make milk foam with it. If we keep using it, the difference down the road will be even larger. It makes no sense for me to keep paying more but getting less. The regular Nespresso or K-cup saw significantly price drop since it came out, and also has a huge selection of coffee now, but Vertuoline would probably never see this day coming, as the price had only went up and some of the coffee is almost never available.Just a caveat from our own experience..\\n\\nI find Nespresso\\'s service and care wanting even as I love their products and coffee pods and was one of first user of Nespresso in my region. I purchased a new VertuoPlus machine last December and tried it out the moment it was delivered. For some reason the machine could not make more coffee after the first pod and even that was defective compared to the samples I had at the store. Not seeing much information in the box on how to return I bought the defective machine back to the store in Macy\\'s. I was told they do not take returns only the Nespresso Club but by then I was going into surgery the next day and could do little. A few weeks later I finally could call Nespresso Club. The rep was very nice said she will email me a return certificate and that I will also be getting a shipping label from UPS. This label never arrived. I called again and this time a rep from 718 area code answered, she could not hold back her contempt when we said we wanted to return the machine. When she instructed us to put the machine out from 8 am to 7 pm every day for the next three days we asked if there was any alternative as we are concerned about porch thieves. She shot back asking if we live in a very high crime neighborhood, and that is just one instant of her many smart lines. Then she told us (between numerous sighs) to write down every word on the instructions she was to give us because we tend to be\" very confused\" in other words having senior moments. For three days I stayed home watching over the machine, no pick up. We felt we had run out of options and I was ready to wait out the weekend and then bring it to UPS store on Monday which by then was about 3 weeks from the time we connected with Nespresso Club. Thankfully on Monday UPS came knocking on the door, had a label and picked up the machine FINALLY! This return took over our lives at a time when I was weak and limited in my movement and should have been spending my time and energy on recovery and rehab instead of fending with a passive/aggressive rep from 718 NYC and all these misinformed instructions. So when we order from the Nespresso Club we are on our own, good luck!Still love this thing and use it every morning!! Highly recommend anyone looking for a coffee machine! I\\'ve been reusing the coffee pods ever since buying this machine and they\\'re still working with the nespresso machine just fine.There are much more expensive espresso machines, but I am not sure they give a better brew. This machine takes pods for either a cup of coffee or for espresso. They are not inexpensive, but they do taste good. The included milk frother also does a good job. Even though they cost more than other coffee pods, they are still less than a drive to that coffee shop, not to mention the overpriced coffee you will find there. This is set up so you will be better off if you join their club. The service is exceptional. If you like espresso, you could do a lot worse than this well designed machine.Hands down, best coffee maker I have ever owned. I have had the keurig, several carafe coffee makers. This blows all machines out of the water. Coffee pods are flavorful, the coffee brews frothy. Officially a coffee snob thanks to this machine. GREAT INVESTMENT!I bought this machine in a retail store after it was demonstrated for me. I was reluctant because I had long given up on the Keurig machines (went through 4 of them in 2 years).\\nVery pleased with this machine. Simple and easy to use. Have used it at least twice a day for 2 months and no issues are present. Plus, the coffees and espressos are top notch delicious!I work in an open office setting and don\\'t need to announce every time I make a cup of coffee in my cubicle. And this fancy thing is super loud, it sounds like it winding up to take off into orbit. I was so excited to order and receive it, tried it out over a weekend, and was soooooo disappointed. I didn\\'t even like the coffees it made, which was even more surprising and disappointing. To Amazon\\'s credit, they accommodated the return without question and immediately credited me.Absolutely fantastic in all aspects. Great strong flavor, at fraction of cost of coffee shops. Variety of espresso and flavored coffee available. No leaks as mentioned in few reviews, its been 3 months. Huge water tank capacity , sturdy build. Great value.I love this machine. Once you remember what cup size to use with a specific pod, this machine is a breeze. I’ve tried all of the 12 of the included blends of coffee that were included with the machine and have since purchased 6 of them to have on hand. I love it.My wife got me this for my birthday and I’m already loving it. It is a great alternative to Keurig, which I’ve always thought made overly hot and tasteless coffee. This machine produces that rich crema and doesn’t make it too hot. The pods can be recycled with a free bag. The kinds of coffee are a little limited, but there’s probably enough to explore. It’s a real bargain for the price.Great value for nespresso. I already have a milk frothed so no need to get a machine with extra bells and whistles to clean. This make delicious nespresso coffee. Not as hot as the original collectionI was skeptical that this could be worth the hefty price tag (note I got my in exchange for an honest review and I still felt that), but I have to say the coffee and espresso it makes it makes is excellent. You can program it to make a larger cup of coffee if you like, but I find that the preprogrammed level is great. The quality of the coffee in the pods is great (though a bit pricey - again better than a coffee house). The milk frother is not completely necessary, but it is a great addition. I\\'m still not 100% sure of the price, but the quality is undeniable and likely worth it for people who love a nice dark cup of coffee or espresso.We bought this in July of 2019 as our backup-I\\'m-too-lazy-to-brew-a-pot maker. We were sick of Keurigs failing. We should have bought a Keurig.\\n\\nThe coffee\\'s pretty good, though it\\'s not normal tasting, it does the job.\\n\\nBut, the machine failed 2 months after the warranty was up. Just before the 200th cup (I counted our orders), the machine started putting less into the cup and started leaking out of the back of the machine. I cleaned it, to no avail.\\n\\nWe have 30 extra pods we\\'re going to give away, then toss the machine. We have a Ninja now that does better single cups.\\n\\nTotal cost per cup of coffee we got out of this piece of junk: $1.81.This is a really easy to use machine. It’s slim profile takes up much less counter space than I’d anticipated. I had planned on just using it occasionally but find that it’s my new everyday coffee maker.Love this new Nespresso machine the price is right and the coffee and espresso it makes are very smooth and mellow. Pods are a bit pricey but still way less than Starbucks. Recycling the aluminum pods is easy with a nearby Bloomie’s.My VertuoPlus lasted just out of warranty. Then my coffee tasted strange and smelling weird.\\n\\nMachine was off, but then the house started smelling weird so I unplugged.\\nChecked and the unit was really hot and electrical burn smelling.\\n\\nCalled for support and Nespresso bounced me to DeLonghi. I told them what happened and they basically said it\\'s out of warranty, pound sand. I told them it could have burned down my house wouldn\\'t you want to know why? They didn\\'t care. Not even a discount on a replacement machine.\\n\\nSo I cut into the machine to see what was the issue.. and the mains were frying the spade connector due to a fault somewhere. There was NO breaker or fuse. I have no idea how this machine got UL listed with the amps it pulls when heating, and the shitty design for the main power supply. Fault - to - Fire and bad DeLonghi customer service? No thanks. Never again with their sub-branded product.\\n\\nNespresso is RAD.. loved them for years and still have my Concept C-190 original espresso pod machine.. like 20 years old. Coffee is bomb. The Vertuo pods are yummy. Support has always been great. It\\'s the farming of their machines out to De\\'China that I don\\'t like. Trying the Vertuo Next now and hoping my experience is better.\\n\\nI only studied engineering (computer/electrical) in college and am an engineer now.. what would I know huh?I like this just as well as my more expressive Nexpresso it tastes the same. So convenient that it makes both coffee and expresso. I didn’t think I would like the coffee because I’m a bit of coffee snob however it’s surprisingly delicious. The layer of foam on top is a nice touchMachine broke in less than a year and now nespresso will not even replace it. The repair cost as much as the machine itself. Will not be buying any nespresso machines ever again. Sticking to Keurig which worked for me for 4 years without a problem.This Nespresso Coffee and Espresso maker is great for coffee lovers. It uses its own pods and the machine can be adjusted to make either regular coffee or espresso. The quality of the coffee, using their pods, is excellent.Good: Simple to use. Starts up fast. No need to wait for preheat to press \"brew\"... if you press the top button a second time it starts the brewing/pouring as soon as the heat-up period is finished. Decent coffee with some pods. Machine stops at the amount of coffee suitable for each pod, and it is easy to stop early, i.e., get less volume than the intended amount.\\nNot so good: The \"crema\" is more of a foam on the top of the coffee/espresso. Gets annoying because it doesn\\'t eventually break down. Nespresso over-engineered its pods to create a long lasting thick foam. Many of the coffee offerings are quite weak; we can strengthen them but cutting back the quantities made. But the espresso simply isn\\'t like a good high pressure / pulled espresso.\\nBad: Nothing. It is a very nice machine if you like their coffees and can tolerate the \"crema\" foam.First of all, the coffee this makes is amazing. However, I probably wouldn\\'t have bought this if I\\'d known how hard it is to get the capsules. They are not readily available at the grocery store. You can only purchase them online from \"authorized sellers,\" and they are a bit more expensive than I was aware at around $1.50 per serving.Makes great tasting hot coffee and hot espresso. I have had no problems yet . The coffee is a bit on the expensive side but the quality is well worth it and you can not beat the variety.Updated:\\n\\nKeeps getting better, went to ship the thing back to NJ, and found return shipping will cost $40 USPS ground. lol. Can\\'t really say shipping a $150 item back for warranty repair is cost effective. Especially given the product is only 6 months old and the damage looks to be from the factory.\\n\\nAfter contacting DeLonghi I am told they no longer service the machine (only six months old). I must contact NespressoClub for service. NespressoClub tells me I must join their \"club\" in order to receive warranty service.\\n\\nStill fuming over this, and after reading many reviews for issues with the machine having other issues with leaks, shutdowns and other odd problems that the \"club\" wants you to buy specialized products for (descaling), not even sure I want to send it in for servicing. Might count my losses (I still have two boxes of coffee pods) and give the pods to someone else.\\n\\nps: Joining their club means allowing them to install a \"special app\" to my browser to allow them to track my coffee and other purchases. Seriously? Who in their right mind installs software that is designed to track their web habits and agrees to this open invasion of privacy? Besides Facebook users, that is.\\n\\nIn any case, I asked for and received a shipping address to return the unit for warranty repair. I am told it will take 14 days minimum for the service - and that shipping delays might be incurred. Basically, once I get the machine in the mail, it will be at least 3 to 4 weeks before I can get it back to use it again.\\n\\nWell, so much for brand (DeLonghi failed me big time) and so much for buying something that seemed to be fair quality from a reputable source (Amazon and Nespresso both failed in this).\\n\\nWhat was that old saying? Caveat Emptor.\\nFirst impression was the lid never opened and closed properly. Always takes two attempts to open. I got used to that quirk and continued using it almost daily (often two or more cups).\\n\\nNow, after six months, the thing is leaking like a sieve. The o-ring in the top is breaking down and chipping away (poorly made rubber does this). So for every cup I make - a portion of coffee is left dribbling out the back of the machine in a large puddle.\\n\\nI\\'m going to see what DeLonghi will do - the thing should have at least a year warranty. Hopefully they can just send a new o-ring/seal whatever it\\'s called.I got this machine on sale at black Friday for $99 thinking it was a steal. I was so dissatisfied to find out you can only order vertuo pods from Nespresso. The shipping is fast and great, and it is easy to to make.\\nWe drink 4 cups a day at my house, so our habit is $120 a month, $1440 a year. We\\'ve had it for over 2 years now, so we\\'ve spent over $3,000 on the pods. I guess it is cheaper than Starbucks, but Starbucks is too expensive for my taste.My order is to arrive on Friday. I\\'m excited. I purchased the Nespresso (NEW)during a Flash Sale,along with the 30 count pods, for a $ 80.00!\\nAfter reading many reviews, and research, I know its going to be ELECTRIC !!I thought nothing could surpass my older model Lattisma One Touch but oh my goodness. The flavor in every sip is remarkable. I’m just starting out trying the various capsules. Haven’t been disappointed yet.This makes premium coffee for half the price of driving to my favorite coffee shop. It stopped working after three months and now stuck with $250 of coffee pods that fit only this machine. No support and apparently no warrantee or guarantee. If you do purchase do not use the wi-fi “feature” it appears to have cause our machine to commit suicide.This is the second Nespresso pod espresso maker that I\\'ve owned and the design on this one is MUCH better than my older model. Not only is it narrower and takes up a bit less space, but it\\'s not as loud, either, and is easier to take apart for cleaning etc. The quality of the coffee it makes is about the same as the older model, which was good enough for a pod machine.\\n\\nHowever, my problem with this pod coffee maker is the same as with the older model - Nespresso\\'s pods are specific to their brand, pricey, and not easy to find (especially if you want a variety of coffee types). If this took the same type of pods as the readily available Keurig-style pods, I would rate it four stars...but it doesn\\'t, so three stars it is.it was a wedding gift but heard from the bride that she was very happyFabulous, coffee is excellent.Worked great for the first 7 months. Now with each use I have to reset it ( per customer secure the reset should been done weekly they said). Each time I call they walk me through resetting and or cleaning. And it works great a few times then goes back to not brewing again. Sounds like it is going to but then nothing. We’ve had it less then a year and all we get from CS is clean it/reset it. Well it’s pretty dang clean since you have to “clean it/reset it every weeks. Just to get a few cups out of it.Be aware! Definitely ruined my husbands birthday surprise.. he loves it but I was definitely a bit disappointedThis product is sleek, easy to use, easy to clean, and prepares perfect coffee every time!While I ordered the bundle, only the machine has arrived and seems like frother went completely missing. Amazon, Nespresso, and Delonhi\\' kept delegating the responsiblities to each other once i reached out to them for sending me the missing part- it consumed so much of my time, terrible experience.\\n\\nIn the end, after begging the Nespresso customer service center multiple times was able to talk to Nespresso team to explain my situation and get my frother sent.. terrible experience.Coffee heaven in a cup. Must have.This will elevate your coffee game permanently.I bought this for my daughter\\'s birthday and she loves it!LOVE this! And good customer service! My machines water tank leaked and the company gave me a loaner machine while they fixed mine. (My understanding is the manufacturer has now changed the water tank seal on new machines so leaking shouldn’t be an issue). Coffee tastes great and produces a nice creme. I now rarely go to coffee shops!Machine keeps breaking down. LOVE THE COFFEE hate the machine. I have been waiting for them to send the machine back going on 3 weeks in repair. after first repair machine started making noise that it did not before it broke.\\n. What they should have done is send me a NEW MACHINE!!\\ncustomer service is VERY NICE but\\' they are clueless regarding their product.\\n2ND TIME!! FOLKS in less than ! YEAR!\\n\\n**UPDATE company sent me a new machine*** Thanks ! changing to 3 starsExcellent product! I love Nespresso!The DeLonghi version is a piece of garbage. Needs constant resetting. Had to go on YouTube to figure it out. Website for help sucks! Get the competitors\\' version instead!!! Hate having to reset every time I need to make a freaking cup of coffee.Love it!I loved this machine but now, like other reviewers have stated, it leaks out the back. I’ve kept it very clean and the used pods go directly in the trash and don’t sit in the holder. It’s also very noisy since day one. This is a shame because I love the coffee more than my Keurig. Guess this one is going in the trash pile :-(.For about $1.50, you get almost 2 teaspoons of coffee. That means you are paying over $20 per lb. for your coffee. Yes, you are paying less than you would for a professionally made latte but when you are out and about and you want a coffee, you also pay for the experience and convenience. However, when you are at home, do you expect to pay ultra premium prices for something you have to make yourself? A pound of Starbucks Espresso roast to brew at home is roughly half the price of the Nespresso capsules. Even Starbucks who overcharges for their coffee knows that making it at home should be less expensive than having something made for you. Nespresso sells you on the fact that it\\'s less than buying something that is professionally made so you don\\'t notice that you are paying $20 a lb. for coffee and then you have to prepare your own milk and add your own flavoring (if desired) in order to get something that is roughly the same as the professionally made version. To top it off, you are locked into $20+ a lb coffee because they don\\'t want any competition and they add DRM to the pods. If they believed in their product, they could just sell it at a fair price but one major reason for DRM is so they don\\'t have to be good, they just have to get you to buy. Once you are in, you are locked in. They made it easy to use, the espresso and coffee are good but they make it virtually impossible to get the pods and they charge ultra premium prices for something that you can get for less than 1/4 the cost if you get a grind your own espresso machine. It might be a little different if you could pick up some coffee locally but all of the advertised \"convenience\" is thrown out the window because you have to order the pods and wait for them to arrive... unless you want to pay even more... smh.Can’t complain.. I read other reviews and can’t say I agree with anything that was previously said. I used this nesspresso daily and the cups come out fantastic. Good bye Starbucks!!I purchased this machine as a holiday gift for myself last year. I’ve already had to send it back to be repaired once and now it has quit working again. I called Nespresso and they won’t replace it even with my 1 year warranty still active. The machine enters some sort of flushing or descaling mode with a single push of the brew button and then won’t turn on for a few days after it’s done. My original Nespresso machine was the best. I would not buy this one. I just purchased a Vertuo Next to replace this one, but will be returning it. The machine is so loud it wakes everyone in the house up and the open close mechanism is clunky and difficult…no quiet morning coffee for me. Time to find a new espresso maker ;(Love itcannot believe how few times it worked before it would not power up again..If you\\'ve never had coffee from a Nespresso Vertuo machine, you owe it to yourself to try it out. It is a whole level beyond Keurig-type brewing.\\n\\nMost coffee makers use some variation of pouring hot water over coffee grounds, from standard drip machines to the convenience of Keurig machines. The first generation Nespresso machine used the traditional Espresso technique of pressurized water forced through the coffee grounds. While this produces superior coffee, it also is loud because of the pressurized pump required, and is also prone to mechanical failure. The new generation Vertuo machines use a entirely new way of making coffee by putting the coffee pod in a miniature centrifuge and using that pressure to drive the hot water through the coffee instead of using hydraulic pressure. The result is fantastic-- a rich coffee with an amazing crema that is the equal or better to any you\\'ve ever tasted.\\n\\nThe pros: it gives a rich brewed crema to both espresso and regular coffee blends. It is super easy to use and quiet and actually is smaller than my Keurig. It gives coffee that is the equal or better to Starbucks, especially if you use a separate frother when you blend in milk or cream.\\nThe cons: EXPENSE. The pods are only sold by Nespresso, are limited in availability, and cost over a buck a piece. That\\'s why I would really recommend to try before you buy if you can--- if you truly love great coffee or if you want to cut back on your Starbucks habit but can\\'t face just ordinary drip coffee, this Nespresso could be your new best friend.Coffee is surprisingly creamy and foamy. Excellent.About 1/3 of the coffee is this foam, not crema. By the time I pour most of it out I have a short cup. The coffee is good but not better than some brands from my Keirg. Wish I would have returned it when I had the chance. Save your money and by the Keirg.Mostly great but the system is leaking and squirting coffee all over. I Called corporate and they helped me clean it out but it’s still doing it.\\nThe espresso is awesome though so I’m sure once it’s fixed I’ll love it again.We got to sample the Nespresso while on a vacation, and now you can bring a little bit of the vacation with you. Easy to use and it\\'s space saving design- not to mention the machinery created by DeLonghi, who we have used products that are quality made and stand the test of time- you will not be disappointed!I love the Nespresso coffees and experience. It’s creamy luscious ness . But .. our second machine in 3 years has just started leaking. I will buy another but so disappointed.Lasted about a year and now it leaks.I would absolutely steer clear of buying anything with the Delonghi brand name. For starters, I have been hooked on the Nespresso brand, they make amazing coffee, but the Delonghi brand just doesn\\'t hold up. My first Delonghi machine broke within the one year time frame, apparently the diagnosis was that the motor burned out. Nespresso was nice enough to warranty it in exemplary fashion. They even shipped a box to my house to send it back to them in and I had the same(but brand new) replacement machine sent almost immediately back to me. Problem is, my second Delonghi machine broke in just shy of two years, which is outside of the warranty window of 1 year. So, in a nuthshell, I have had a nespresso machine for just shy of 3 years now and I am entering in to needing a third machine. This is ridiculous. I know if many inexpensive coffee machines owned by friends and they never have any problems and the machines last years and years. Delonghi is a total piece of shi$ and I wouldn\\'t waste even $10 on this brand of machine. Do yourself a favor and buy a Nespresso by Breville which friends of mine have had for 7 and 10 years, they are still rocking great coffee. If you don\\'t listen to my advice, you will be purchasing a replacement within the next 2 years because the machine won\\'t last. I guarantee it. If you pay close attentions to the reviews, there is a overwhelming number of dissatisfied people, NOT with the Nespresso brand, but with the performance and longevity of the Delonghi brand machine itself.My doctors office has one of these amazing coffee makers in the waiting room. I no longer dread the wait to be seen. Just like going to any upscale coffee house! Can’t wait to get one for home use...So your relatively new Vertuo is leaking from underneath (badly):\\n\\nStep 1: Do not package up the machine expecting to take it to your local Bistro for repair.\\n\\n2. Call the Coffee Club hot line when you return from the Bistro having discovered they send you back home. 877.964.6299\\n\\n3. The very sweet, helpful & nice lady Sashana will help you through a testing of the machine. My machine failed the process and leaked much worse.

Read others posts here in this group This machine even after only using filtered water and cleaning as instructed still leaked after about 7 months usage.\\n\\n10. Love this group. Thank you to the founders and administration.The one-touch feature and excellent coffee of this DeLonghi VertuoPlus Titan machine sold me on the spot during a demo in a local kitchen store. That was early July 2018, five months later in December 2018, we noticed coffee puddling around the rotor well where the capsule is placed. By January 2019 the amount of leaked coffee had progressed to the point where I called Nespresso and after some discussions about \"run a cleaning cycle and then call us back\" I convinced them that was not the problem and they issued a repair (UPS shipping) to correct the problem. That went quick and easy in less than a week and the repair paperwork indicated them replacing the \"Top Rotor\". Note that on an average day we make two cups of coffee and on the weekend about four or six each day. I did use the cleaning cycle and descaled every four months. So now eight months after the repair we suddenly have lots of coffee puddling around the capsule well and so much that it\\'s running out the back of the machine and onto the counter. Of course, it\\'s out of warranty and therefore it\\'s junk and I need to advise prospective buyers that this unit, made with all plastic, will fail! DeLonghi did not perform very well on this design-- there are many other reports of this problem on the Internet. I suggest looking at the Breville design, which appears to be better all around from materials and quality perspective.I ordered directly from Nespresso but still worth hearing. First off I ordered this machine and they sent me the completely wrong machine (the Evoluo), and I called to have it returned and sent a new one but it wouldn\\'t have arrived before Christmas and since the Evoluo had better reviews I said I\\'ll just keep it. Now after Christmas, I go to use the Evoluo and it LEAKS EVERYWHERE. I called to troubleshoot and it was a machine issue not a water tank issue so they gave me the option of sending it back for repairs. I\\'ve read reviews about people sending it back for repairs and it doesn\\'t get fixed so I\\'m not doing that. So I ask for a return and refund, BUT because \"I opened it and used it\" (once, I may add, before finding out it was completely faulty), I have to pay for this giant heavy box to be returned to them – they won\\'t even send a return label. I also asked if I could just return it now for the machine I ordered in the first place, but nope because I said I\\'d just keep it before finding out it didn\\'t work I can\\'t do either. So as a first time customer – I strongly don\\'t recommend. I ordered because I\\'ve had their coffee before and I loved it, but clearly didn\\'t know their customer service and machine quality are terrible. My gift to my dad for Christmas is ruined and it\\'s going to be a while until I get my money back to get him something else. Thanks Nespresso.Coffee cups are too expensive. Taste is good. Biggest neg is the 1/2 inch layer of foam that comes on top of every cup brewed. And, that the coffee is not hot, needs another 30 sec in microwave.My second machine in 2 years died this morning. My wife got her cup of coffee, then it died. The machine are absolute crap. The coffee is fabulous (expensive, but fabulous). I think I’m done.Sent this to my daughter in law, and WOW does she loves this!This is the best coffee maker ever!Sent it to my daughter and she loves it!!The pods are expensive. My theory is that Nestle made this new Vertuo line because the patent on the old version ran out and other companies can make pods. Now I have this new version and am stuck only able to buy the Nestle brand which almost no one carries, envious of all the options I could have had if I bought the original version.Bought it new. From day one it made a terrible sound like plastic breaking at the beginning and end of the brewing cycle. Guests would use it and say \"OMG I broke it!\" And I\\'m like \"Nah. That\\'s just how it sounds\" (because what do I know, right?). Turns out the male part of the mechanism that moves the infuser was misaligned. So it repeatedly broke through the female part, engaging and disengaging loudly every time. Eventually, of course, it broke off so much of the female piece that it wouldn\\'t work at all. DiLonghi\\'s response? We\\'ll give you 30% of a new machine. No thanks. Been there done that, moving on to a brand that isn\\'t inherently defective. You should too.I bought a Nesprosso plus by De\\'longhi BNV425MTB Same machine as (Nespresso by De\\'Longhi ENV155BAE VertuoPlus Deluxe) just it came with a Frother. First thing right out of the box worked great at least I thought so, realized it wasn\\'t making the right amount of coffee, I read the directions (really I did) reprogramed as directed but it didn\\'t remember the new program. Call Nespresso went through the same directions three more times wasting coffee, but finally it did remember the program. worked fine for about a week. Now it leaks coffee all over the place. Good new is, I called Nespresso again and was told they would send a box so I could send it back for repair, free of charged, I asked how long it was going to take to get repaired, their reply was 2 to3 week after they recieved it back. I told them I only had this for only 3 week asked them for a new one or I was just going to take it back to the store and get my money back. Nespresso is send me a New machine, Said I should recieve it in two days. today is 12-23-19The coffee is amazing WHEN it works. The machine stopped working 3 days after purchasing it. It goes to brew but then stops and gives a red light. I’ve spent hours on the phone with customer service, descaled, reset to factory settings, unplugged for days, and repeated 100 times. It will randomly work for a few days or weeks and then the process has to be started all over again. We were told the red flashing light means the sensor isn’t reading the code. Nespresso had us ship it to them to be fixed and sent us an older version to use temporarily (we wanted to keep that one because it worked). They sent out “fixed” machine back which worked for 3 days and then that dreaded red light came back when you hit brew. They were good about replacing most our pods but it’s annoying not being confident that you’ll get morning cup of coffee. The warranty has expired so now we’re stuck with it and the thought of sitting on the phone with them for hours going through the same steps that we go through every week is just not the best use of time. The coffee is incredible but save your time and money and don’t buy this machine. Maybe one of the other machines is better but we’re not willing to invest on a chance.Bought this machine because I had always wanted one. It does make delicious coffee...when the machine works. The most cups I have been able to make has been 5, before the machine indicates it needs \"descaling.\" Once it decides it needs descaling, it will not make coffee. You must buy their own descaling solution and then go through a 14 step process to descale. I have never used anything in the machine except purified water, no tap water, so I have no idea why it needs descaling so often. It\\'s extremely maddening to want a quick cup of coffee, but have to go through the descaling process instead. I\\'m thinking of just throwing the machine away, but, I\\'m going to be stuck with a lot of expensive coffee pods. Very disappointing.It\\'s a piece of crap.We are in our second machine. The first one leaked after a couple months of use. This one just stopped responding. It was a gift from my daughter. I\\'m glad I didn\\'t buy it. I would be percolating.I got this for my sister as a graduation present May 2020. It\\'s August 2021, and it is broken. Nespresso is saying that it\\'s out of warranty so she\\'s SOL. For what this costs, I would expect it to last well beyond a year. Save your money. Keurig seems to last much longer.I purchased this machine just over a year ago. I was very happy in the beginning but about a month ago, I started to notice coffee leaking out under the machine while it was brewing a cup. I thought maybe it needed a cleaning or a descaling. I tried both and that didn\\'t help. I spoke to an employee at the Nespresso store and he told me that there must be something broken on the inside of the machine. I really thought that this machine would last longer than a year. I believe they give you a year warranty and I have tried calling the Nespresso club but the wait time is so long that it\\'s hard to speak to anyone. Unfortunately, if you are looking for a new coffee maker, I would pass on this one.Such a disappointment with this machine. The coffee is great and it is easy to use. Sadly, the first one I bought only lasted 5 months before it started leaking all over the counter (yes I cleaned it and de-scaled it regularly). After spending an hour on the phone with the helpline trying to get it fixed, I was told it needs to be sent out for servicing. 3 weeks later (without a coffee machine) I heard back that it can\\'t be repaired and that I would get a new one in 10 days. I would\\'ve been happy with this type of customer service had I not been without a coffee machine for 3+ weeks.\\n\\nSo, new machine, surely, this one won\\'t have any issues, right? Wrong. 6 months later and machine stopped working. After another hour on the phone with the helpline, I was told that it would have to go out for servicing. Nothing I could say to convince them to just send me a replacement machine while they repaired / refurbished my machine worked. So, here we go, another month without coffee.\\n\\nSave your money, buy something that is more durable or that has better customer service.I got this last year for Christmas. It worked beautifully for a while. Fast forward to June of this year and I notice some espresso puddles starting to appear. I clean it thinking it was a one time thing. Nope. It started getting worse. Followed all the proper maintenance instructions, descaling, etc. Called Nespresso, who walked me through troubleshooting the leak. It didn’t work. Still leaking. According to the reviews on the Nespresso website, this particular model has a history or leaking. As of now my machine is being “repaired” by Nespresso. It takes 3-5 weeks. Which also happens right around the same time the warranty expires. Fingers crossed it gets fixed but I don’t have my hopes set very high.updated review May 2020\\n2 out of 5 star\\nIn less than 1 year the VertuPlus begins to leak where the coffee is extracted from the capsule, read the online forum and it appears to be a known manufacture issue. Nepresso sells on convenience and quality, but now I\\'m frustrated after buying this expensive vertuo plus delux machine AND ordering monthly capsules from the Nespresso website. Did they purposely design a machine to break down this easily? horrible experience, called customer service to get a shipping label for maintenance and repair. 2 stars given, 1 for the lousy machine, 1 star for customer service with the hope nespresso will repair or replace this broken machine.\\n\\nold review\\n1 out of 5 star\\nhad this vertuoplus deluxe for a few months and it continues to malfunction and waste coffee capsules by pulling a short shot instead of a full cup. ran the cleaning cycle several times and searched online for answers. If Nespresso makes a crap product this is a disservice, simply outrageous to spend lots of money on a machine and capsules without it working consistently.I was so excited to receive this. I decided to splurge when my coffee pot went out. 1.) you HAVE TO USE THEIR CAPSULES. And they are much pricier than I expected. 2.) This machine is LOUD!!!! it sounds like a rocket shipping off to space every time I brew a cup of coffee. Not so great when I want to enjoy a cup of coffee before the rest of the house wakes up. 3.) sometimes it doesn’t work right. You put a capsule in and press the button and nothing happens. Have to reopen it and start again, but because when you open it the capsules slides back to the empty tray even though you weren’t able to use it. You have to fish the capsule out and wipe out the coffee that spilled out because it already punctured the capsule. This happens every other morning so it gets pretty annoying. Knowing what I know now, I would have bought a keurig and saved myself some money.I sent this to a friend as a house warming present. The frother did not work and was used.\\nSo embarrassingI can’t recommend this item. It worked OK for a while, I didn’t use it that often, but then it began leaking large amounts of brewed coffee with each cup I would make. I got the impression from Nespresso support it may be a “problem“ machine. I would not order it again. I’m gonna try the Evoluo model now, Nespresso is going to give me a substantial discount on it so I’m hoping that works better than this one.This machine works great with the espresso pods, but anything designated as \"coffee\" ends up being kind of thin and watery tasting. I really expected more out these pods considering that cost around $1 each. I can use 4 of the small pods to make a really good tasting cup of strong coffee, but that costs like $4. Might as well go to Starbucks or Tim Horton\\'s. After a year of use, I\\'m going to be retiring the machine and moving on to a different brewing method that makes stronger tasting coffee.Threw it away today, with it only lasting a little over a year. Water started leaking out of the bottom and it just flashes red now. I let it sit for another few months while I debated whether to go back to Keurig, which I will even though I still have $50 worth of Nespresso pods. I would not recommend buying a Nespresso as this seems to be pretty common. An office I visited even had two for when one inevitably broke.I have used this product gently, to make about one cup of coffee each day, since I bought it last year (less than 13 months ago), and all of a sudden it is broken and leaking coffee all over. There was nothing to cause it to break and it was not being over-used. The coffee is delicious, definitely my favorite of the pod-model machines on the market, but I can\\'t spend this kind of money on a product that breaks so quickly.After being in Europe summer of 2019 I came back wanting my own machine! I received this machine for Christmas 2019. It has not even been a year of use and this machine began leaking yesterday! I got online and read up on it! I ran a cleaning cycle and then I used a toothpick to clean the coffee granules from the seal. It still leaks! Highly dangerous Nestle with this being a product that has to be plugged into electricity! I am terrified to use it now in case I catch something on fire! This has been an issue for plenty of Vertuo Buyers! BEWARE! I would have NEVER asked for this had I known about this issue! Excitement got the best of me. I do not want a repaired machine either after reading reviews!Similar to the review right below mine, my machine has entered perpetual “need to descale” mode and is not working after my first descaling process. They have made the process so convoluted so at first I thought it was doing it incorrectly....however, after checking with independent posts on the internet as far as instructions I was doing it right, but the machine is just messed up.\\n\\nA sign that this might be a problem is that if you purchase the descaling solution from Nespresso, it does not come with instructions with it and they refer you to the website because you have to watch a video in order to see the instructions.\\n\\nI will maybe try a different Nespresso machine manufacturer when I toss this one because I think maybe Nespresso should just stick to making the coffee and outsource their machine product to someone who knows how to make appliances.I would give this product 5 stars if it hadn\\'t started leaking at the top where the coffee pad is leading to coffee running out the back end and creating a nice mess. For about 18 months, loved this machine. Great tasting coffee and easy to use. Now, unless you stand there with a rag to mop up the coffee as it leaks during a coffee making, you\\'re going to have a big mess to clean up with every cup. Lots of complaints about this on Amazon, YouTube, etc., so obviously a known problem that Nespresso has not deemed worthy of fixing. Too bad, they\\'re losing a lot of money on coffee I\\'m now back to brewing in my Norelco coffee maker.I used this product at school successfully for most of last school year, but after I returned back to school this year after summer break and went through the descaling and other cleaning procedures specified by the machine, the machine now leaks from the capsule canister as well as the nest-area where the capsules are brewed. This is ridiculous and unacceptable quality for such an expensive product. Very disappointed.Original review: The machine is fine overall and makes a fine cup of espresso. However, about 1 in 5 times the unit will not process one of the pods. I have to manually reinsert a few times to get it to work. Very frustrating.\\n\\nJUST DOWNGRADED to one star. 9 times out of 10 the unit does not work. You have to eject the pod, reinsert several times, and eventually it will work. This makes a mess and you get grounds in the coffee. A real downer because my wife loves the coffee when the machine functions.I loved this machine while it lasted! Then it started leaking: a puddle of coffee underneath it every time we brew. Worst part - we\\'ve had this thing for just about 8 months! Of course the Amazon return window had passed, so I called Nespresso who wants me to send the machine in for repair. What a pain!! Your product is defective, just send me a new machine! In my opinion, this is not adequate customer support.I had no idea this was a pod system, so after trying all the different variety packs, the good ones were tiny size. I wasted money on a bunch of \\'large cups\\' and they weren\\'t very large at all. I drink a lot of coffee. Machine is also very slow. No filter options...no reusable pods. Kept buying more and hoping it would be better. Wasn\\'t. I still have mine sitting here, as I bought a keurig and like much much better. $30 for keurig gets you 72 pods. $33 for 30 for Nespresso, tiny, cruddy cups. You might as well buy starbucks/dunkin every day tbh. Just as expensive.\\n\\nJust hoping I can sell mine even for a little. Do this at risk. Was not worth it. There are better options.I bought this machine directly from Nespresso, but I wanted to leave a review here as a warning. This is the second time I’m sending this machine back for repairs and I just purchased it November 2020. I’ve only had it for 3 1/2 months! The brew button just stops working and is really touchy...maybe I got a dud who knows. I love the machine when it works, makes a great cup of coffee, but not worth the hassle when you have to return it once a month to be repaired. I would probably purchase the older machine if I had a do-over.I used the machine only one time a day for a year - called the hotline (b/c online they say the warranty is 2 years on all Nespresso machines) and was told I could send it in for $125 to be fixed. Well, a new machine costs less than that. Went back to my Keurig which tastes half as good but is still going strong 10 years after purchase.... bad customer service at best. Even stranger that they had the nerve to offer a fix for less than the machine is worth brand new. All around disappointed.We purchased this through Sur La Table and are on our second machine in two weeks. The canister leaks terribly, like a puddle of water under the machine at all times. This has been so frustrating, as each time we’ve called the Nespresso club, the hold time is over 20 mins. I’ve resorted to emailing them, hoping for a fix. We’ll be taking this back(again) if they cannot provide one.\\nStill makes good coffee, but unfortunately has a major design flaw.I received the machine as a Christmas present and we tried to get it working. It started leaking immediately and nothing we tried would stop the leaking. I called the company to find out how to return the machine and was told I had to pay to return it. This is a defective item!!! I should not have to pay to return an item that is defective, that floods my counter every time I use it. When I asked to speak with a manager I was told they would get back to me in 24-48 hours. All of this was \"in policy\" The customer service agent just kept repeating \"I understand\" like he was reading from a script. It was the most useless conversation. If you currently have a Keurig, I suggest you stick with it. It won\\'t flood your counters with water and customer service is pretty good.I\\'ve had this machine for just over a year and had to get the head replaced after a few months. Now that it\\'s been not quite 13 months, the machine fails again with a solid red light and the warranty is two weeks past. The coffee is definitely better than anything i\\'ve had with Keurig.We were SHOCKED to find that we had to buy original Nespresso pods which are $1 per pod, no matter the strength of coffee!!!! Deal breaker for sure because I cannot afford to spend that much on home brewed coffee. We thought having this would save us from purchasing Starbucks/Dutch Bros. Well played Nespresso! This machine is going back!\\nUpdate: less than 1 week of use and water tank leaks!I dislike the coffee. It’s not that it’s too strong, but lots of people including myself have said that it unsettles my stomach - and I typically drink strong coffee as it is.\\nNespresso must have an iron clad patent on their pods because there’s no other pod choice available for Vertuo pods.Love the flavor and intensity of the coffee but it leaks a lot after 6 months. See the photo. I\\'ve tried adjusting the position of the wate container but what is coming out is coffee - it is leaking from somewhere inside the unit.\\n\\nI called customer service and 15 minutes later, I have to hang up, wait 15 minutes and call back so they can do more troubleshooting with the machine cold. The coffee is quite pricey, I expected better from the machine. Wish I could just get a refund and purchase a different brand. I have $200+ in coffee pods that I can\\'t use.Love the coffee but in a descaling operation the darn thing quit working. It’s in their shop now and I really hope they can get it up and running again. My kids gave it to me fo my birthday in Oct 1918 so it just made it bout a year. Not really good enough. But do love the coffee!Very unhappy with purchase. Knew it was capable of using the new Nespresso Vertuo capsules but it was very unclear on Amazon that it was not compatible with the original Nespresso capsules. Misleading product which I believe is deliberate to force everyone to upgrade to a more expensive “improved” product. Buyer Beware!!I have had this machine for a year now. It is easy to use and makes great coffee. My 3 star rating is because the machine started to leak coffee all over my counter about a month agoThese are made to make great coffee. They are not made to last. I cleaned mine regularly and right after they are out of warranty, they stop. The manufacturer offers to fix or sell you another machine. I can buy a machine on Amazon cheaper than any offer the maker makes. I will miss the coffee, but buying a new machine every year is not something I am willing to do. Goodbye Nespresso!All I can say is don’t buy it! Coffee doesn’t stay hot. Each different type of coffee pod brews differently. Example coffee strength, froth and heat! Our cups of coffee where never hot enough. You expect your coffee to be hot and stay hot for more than a couple of minutes. Then you have to buy the de scaling product from them only. Then what an absolute nightmare doing the de scaling process. Our machine broke down and sent it to the manufacturer to repair it. 6 months later broke down again. Now out of 1 year warranty no recourse. They only offer 2 to 3 types of decaf pods very limited! Stay away buy something else.The machine was great for about 9 months, one day it started leaking out the back. Tried to get ahold of customer service... transferred multiple times ... no help and then on hold for well, still on hold. Tried to write in, never got a reply. Tried to write in again, oh wow convenient error message. So, if you are lucky enough to get a machine that does not break down, it\\'s great.This product started leaking coffee after one year. I highly recommend that everyone avoid purchasing this product through Amazon. I have recently become very skeptical of the products sold by Amazon. How does one know whether the product is a knock-off? Except for the most mundane products, I will restrict my Amazon purchases to the manufacturer\\'s Amazon store.Machine stopped working after 3 months. Did the cleaning and didn’t help. Called customer service 3 times said they would call me back within the hour...no call back. Lid wouldn’t open, light won’t come on. Additionally the pods are too pricey(over a buck apiece)! Looks like this piece of trash is going in the trash.The machine will work great for a few months and will then start leaking. It will start small and you will hardly notice then after about 10 months the coffee will be pouring out of the rear of the machine when it is brewing. Looks great and makes great coffee but will only last months.After one year of using this machine, it stop working and each time I had to go through the manual to re-start the machine. keep blinking red light and had to repeat the manual instruction multiple times. I descaled the machine, still the machine won\\'t work!\\nI do not recommend this machineI\\'ve had this machine for 18 months. The coffee is wonderful and I used the cleaning cycle and descaled when required. It now leaks coffee out that back of the machine. After working through the trouble shooting with Nespresso it now has to be sent back to be repaired. Save yourself the trouble and get a different brand.Do not buy this. The product has a defect where it starts to leak after a few months of use. You will receive no support from the manufacturer and amazon will only offer a partial refund if you send it back (cost alone of packing, etc.), not worth it. The coffee is average and not hot enough. It will also burn and ruin your countertops from the leak which causes a fire hazard due to the cord location.Not for real coffee drinkers. This company should stick to espresso. My husband and myself each drink a 20 oz mug each morning, then my husband has a 20 oz. to-go travel mug for work. Do you have any idea how expensive this is lol. The coffee was so watery, a lot of foam, not hot enough, gross! I would give this machine 5 stars if I was reviewing espresso, but this is marketed for coffee which it does not deliver on.Machine sucks. Stops working. Doesn’t make the correct amount. Sent it back for repair. First cup it made was incorrect and it never made another one after. Don’t buy Nespresso. Find a different manufacturer.We got this for Christmas 2019. By March 20th 2020 it started leaking coffee out of the back all over the counter. Nespresso sent us an email how to clean it with a toothbrush and toothpicks.\\nDid not work.\\nIt\\'s as if the pod isn\\'t being pushed down far enough and when it sound up to 7,000 rpm, it\\'s sending all that extra coffee out the back to the used pod container and subsequently the counter.\\nPoor design.Got this for a Christmas gift. Did exactly what the instructions stated as far as flushing the system prior to the coffee making process. Made 3, count them, 3 cups of coffee. First two hot and not too bad. The third ice cold. Tried to make next cup and a constant red light appeared. Had to unplug the system and the system locked. To call the customer service is a joke. 18 different call centers and no one could help. Well not a pleasant experience. Don’t waste time or resources on this.Tastes great when you can get it to brew. One brew every 4-5 attempts. Water will not brew thrugh the pod. Kicks out the pod. Have to reset. Sometimes have to unplug and reset. The $1+ per cup price is not worth it because EVERY TIME I CALLED for help, all they wanted me to do is clean it. Will return for my money back. It is only 26 days old.Horrible product. No customer support.\\nRoutinely brews 1/2 - 1/3 of stated brew size.\\nHave contacted Nespresso multiple times and the only advice is to “clean it.”Total crap. I dont know how Amazon and Nespresso lend their good name to such a terrible product. I bought it to replace my espresso machine since I like the the Nespresso pods. Was not aware I would get something not manufactured by a Nestle subsidiary. And made in Ukraine rather than Switzerland. It leaks, it breaks, joints come undone, impossible to clean without messing up your whole kitchen...a nightmare to use, please please stay away !LOUD!Wrong model sent. On top of that, even when it was labeled as new, the machine had several water marks and coffee residue.Top button completely unresponsive after minimal use.Expensive, very limited selection pods.Had this machine working fine for a lovely 8 months and spent easily $1,000 on the pods already I really love them, but now it’s leaking a from the back somewhere...I’m sooo disappointed I really hope it’s covered by the 1 year manufacturers warranty 😭I ordered the bundle but the milk frother is missing.Like many other reviewers my machine started leaking. One day I noticed leaked coffee all over my counter and under the machine. Gave the machine a good cleaning and descaled. Still leaking! What a waste.After less than a year, this product is starting to deteriorate. Over the last couple of weeks I have noticed the coffee is starting to Pour out of the back into the used pod reservoirLiterally on the first use, this machine leaked water everywhere!! I am returning for a different Nespresso model in hopes that it doesn’t leak.Errrrrghh! I read the reviews and still bought this. Guess what? After a month of using, it is leaking coffee.\\nCalled Nespresso and they are taking it back to “repair.”\\nSo disappointed and annoyed.Missing parts for my aeroccino :(It is designed to break after a few months. It will leak everytime and there is no fix.Machine leaked coffee when brewing after 11 months and now warranty expired. Tried to deescalate and spent more money buying the solution, still leaking coffee.Mine started leaking coffee out the back.Overall I really like this machine. While there are some minor quirks about owning a machine like this, I find myself enjoying it and the convenience is great, especially for having coffee one cup at a time.\\n\\nPackaging:\\nThe packaging is fantastic quality both in appearance and for product protection. Colors on the printing were great and definitely works well if giving this as a gift.\\n\\nMachine Appearance:\\nThe look of this is machine is fantastic. Most of the unit is a shiny \\'piano black\\', along with some matte black and metallic plastic buttons. Any metal parts have a nice bright shine to it. The water reservoir is robust and clear to see water levels. The machine takes up a little more counterspace than my old coffee maker. Overall it has my approval on looks and build quality.\\n\\nMachine Setup:\\nSetup of the unit is easy. Be sure to read thru the quickstart manual to ensure the machine \\'self-cleans\\' prior to initial use. Adding water is as simple as removing the reservoir, filling it with water, and putting it back in the machine.\\nControls are simple. Click the handle up and the machine opens. Put pod in, click the handle down, and it closes. Hit the button on the top of the machine and it warms up the water and then dispenses your coffee or espresso.\\nThe machine does not take much time to get the water hot. I was actually surprised that after a minute or two it begins pouring the coffee and that the water \\'warm up time\\' was not longer than it was.\\n\\nThere is adjustment for the amount of water per pod type also. The controls for water adjustment are a little difficult as you need to hold down buttons while actually making coffee. It is explained in detail how to accomplish this. The nice thing is that if you ever feel the need to adjust the amount of water dispensed thru a specific type of pod, it will always remember how much water you prefer. Sadly there is no way to tell if you are on the \\'default\\' or a \\'custom\\' amount. It is great that it only adjusts the water for the specific pod you have in the machine. For example if you want a little bit stronger vanilla type and adjust the water quantity, it does not change the water amount in any other pods, only vanilla that you adjusted. The machine remembers and stores the information for each pod type.\\nTo be honest, I have only tried changing these settings a few times to see how it worked, and then I realized that the machine and pods were pretty much set up properly in the first place. Nice though that you can fine tune it to your liking if required and that it only affects one flavor pod. Difficult as there is no way to tell what setting you are on.\\n\\nCleaning:\\nFor the exterior of the machine and for any other areas, a damp towel works well. Not much cleaning is required for any surfaces other than a weekly wipedown during routine kitchen cleaning.\\n\\nI love that the unit has its own \\'wastebin\\' for the used pods. There is a rail system that will automatically lift the pods up and slides them into the wastebin. Wastebin is large enough to store 15-20 used pods and simple to wash if it ever becomes dirty. The bin is magnetic for easy removing, dumping, and putting back.\\n\\nOne thing to pay attention to, is that the machine requires a special solution that you need to run thru the machine for cleaning. This is to avoid mineral buildup, so be sure to be prepared for this type of cleaning when the machine tells you for this maintenance.\\n\\nPods/Coffee/Espresso packs:\\nThe machine does come with a sampler of very colorful coffee and espresso pods that are available. While it did not include every flavor offered, there were plenty of different pods to sample to see which I liked. Pods are well constructed in that the foil and aluminum body is sufficient to protect the grounds. I have \\'dented\\' the pods on purpose, and they still function properly within the machine.\\n\\nMilk frother:\\nIt does work very well for both cold and hot frothing. It utilizes a magnetic \\'clutch\\' for the stirring device which allows for very easy cleaning. The most important thing that I have found is that the amount of milk really matters. Put in too much milk, and you will find yourself having much more milk than froth. However, as with any \\'tool\\' you will need to learn how to use it properly. I have had the best luck with whole milk and surprising enough works well with goats milk.\\nThis has been kind of a hit or miss personally since I typically just add milk directly to my espresso/coffee.\\nHaving people over for a proper cup, you can bet that the milk frother is used.\\n\\nNot many negatives to say, but there are some things to pay attention to.\\n1) From time to time, the espresso pods get stuck. If I make a cup of espresso, and do not make coffee again for a day or two, I have found that there is not enough weight for the pod to drop out into the rails and into the wastebin. It gets caught on the spikes that the hot water comes thru when the machine opens. I am aware of this issue, so whenever I have the machine open, I look for the old cup to drop and slide down the rails. If this does not happen, then I just use my finger or a wooden toothpick to get the pod to drop onto the removal rails. Careful as the spikes are sharp.\\nThis is not typically an issue for the actual coffee pods as they are larger/heavier. Another thing that you can do, is immediately after having espresso, open the machine and close it again so the pod will not \\'dry\\' out and stick.\\n\\n2) While this makes a fantastic cup of coffee, you will be stuck at the pricepoint of the pods. I will leave you to compare the current pricing for the costs of pods. Currently, the cost is around double of other \\'pod\\' systems, and 3-4 times the amount of \\'generic\\' types. At the same time, this cost is also on par to that of fast food or gas stations (with Nespresso tasting far superior), and much less than the specialty coffee shops. So if you pay more than a dollar a cup at the coffee shop, this can be a cheaper and more convenient solution.\\n\\n3) Coffee Flavor Choices. You will be limited to what is offered. The flavors that are offered are fantastic with an ample selection of flavors ranging from mild to robust, vanilla to caramel. Espresso you have four options. Decaf, you have one option. So perhaps with time, we will have more choices.\\n\\n4) While it makes a fine cup of coffee and espresso, keep the following in mind. Proprietary cups means that you will not be brewing coffee with your own beans. This in turn means that you cannot get rid of your existing coffee machine on the counter.\\n\\nQuick Summary:\\nAbility to make coffee: 10/10 - Makes a cup of coffee easily and without fuss\\nPackaging (looks/protection): 10/10 - Colors are great and care has gone into packaging\\nEase of use: 8/10 - Simple to make coffee, little difficult to adjust settings (not that you really need to do this)\\nValue: 7/10 - Nice high end machine that looks great, cheaper than coffee shops, more expensive than other brands.\\n\\nOverall satisfaction: 9/10.\\nI really like this machine and the coffee/espresso it makes.\\nI would like to see more flavors come out, and the ability to utilize my own coffee beans.\\nWould make a fantastic gift for anybody who enjoys coffee and espresso.The machine is a reasonable price. The pods, however, are not. Nespresso charges $1.62 per pod now, which is very expensive. I no longer use my machine and switched back to regular bagged coffee. Much cheaper and more deliciousHad this Nespresso for only 6 months and all of a sudden it is spewing coffee out the back! What kind of design is this?? Picture attached.I am giving this 3 stars and am feeling kind of badly about it. It may be my own issues with it, but I do indeed have a few complaints.\\n\\nThe water tank, which swings around in order to save space, doesn\\'t really save space. It only moves so far to the side and it doesn\\'t sit flush beside the machine. It drives me crazy because it looks like it should be moved forward a little and straightened out. When moved as far as it goes to the side towa rd d the front it still sits back further than the machine, so the tank and the machine could never sit flush against the wall/back splash for example. Perhaps my own pet peeve, but it does indeed irritate me that I can\\'t straighten it out and it always looks crooked. You can of course swing it back behind the machine and then it sets nicely back in the corner of the counter, but that\\'s not where I wanted to put it (my kitchenaid stand mixer sets in the corner).\\n\\nThe tray to sit your mug on. Oh boy. Maybe I need further advice on this or a different mug, or..? The tray is small. It also has a small lip going around the edge which essentially makes the space on the tray even smaller. I sat an average size mug on the tray and it *just* fits. Theres no room leftover inside between the lip and mug and you have to very deliberately set the mug on the tray to get it inside that lip, otherwise it will sit on top of it and be crooked/wobbly. Technically this isn\\'t an issue, I guess, since the coffee/espresso will still go into the mug. You can move the tray up and down to accommodate for a taller or shorter mug, but there\\'s no adjusting forward or backward. Also, the mug sits right against the machine, so you\\'re really limited on the size of the mug you can use because of the position of the nozzle that puts out the coffee.. it will end up not going in the mug if you have an odd mug shape. For example, I have some where the center of the mug is fatter/wider than the rim of the mug and I can\\'t use those with this machine because the coffee will shoot down half on the rim of the mug and half outside it closer to the machine. (Hope I am explaining this properly and not making it confusing). The size and positioning of the tray and the position of the nozzle should have been a little more thought out better. There needs to be a bigger tray, to accommodate more mug/cup sizes and shapes. The nozzle should then be placed above the center of the tray, that way you have room to set the mug where it needs to be and have the nozzle still at a position to fill with no problem. The other machine I\\'ve been using is set up that way and I can use any size or shape of mug, cup, thermos, etc. It works out very well and is a huge advantage over this VertuoPlus.\\n\\nSo, with that average mug size, (and really I think it is slightly smaller than average because it is sort of a decorative mug and the only one I had that fit properly in the tray), the coffee pods fill the mug to the very top. So, if you want to add creamer, milk, use the frother, etc, you cant because there\\'s no room left in your mug. Now, if you dont usually add anything then I guess this is no problem, but in my house we all use creamers or milk and also use a frother (theres a frother arm on my other machine).\\n\\nThe frother. Hmm. It does a really good job, BUT... its a whole separate appliance which also needs to be plugged in. It has a heavy duty, 3 prong plug. I do not have outlets to spare as it is. I wasnt prepared for this to be plugged in separately and again that it my own personal issue. I didn\\'t think it through thoroughly when looking at the product description before ordering, I guess. So yea, my issue. I do like the convenience of my other machine having the frother arm built in and it works just as good as this separate machine.\\n\\nThere is no \"drip stop\" type feature after you brew. Sometimes it can drip for a while and it irritates me because I want to let the mug sit there so there\\'s no dipping into the tray which results in not needing to clean the tray daily... BUT I don\\'t want to wait til it is done dripping... I want to drink my coffee! Maybe I am spoiled with my other machine and the drip stop?\\n\\nThe VertuoPlus does have some very neat features though and this is why I feel bad to go with the 3 stars. For one thing, I love how it spits the used pods into the pod container after you brew. I like the way the lid is motorized to open and close. Self cleaner feature is a plus, of course. And most of all, this is some really good coffee and espresso! Love the variety pack that it comes with so we could try different flavors and see what we like. Theyre not only yummy, but it\\'s actually pretty. It looks like a box of Christmas balls when you open it, with all the pretty metallic colored pods. I had never tried this brand before, so yes I was impressed with the shiny, pretty colors :)\\n\\nSo, I will come back and add more as I use this longer, but for now these are my main thoughts on this machine. It does make a great beverage, but I feel like the machine itself could use a few improvements in aesthetics and tray size etc to be more accommodating. Also, I\\'m not loving the whole separate appliance frother, though it does a great job.\\n\\nAlso note that this set does not come with any of the mugs you see in the product pictures. It only comes with the variety pack of flavors. The mugs can be bought on the nespresso site. You can also download an app for recipes etc.Leaks when new out of the box. Also threw error codes repeatedly during setup. Open button worked, close button didn\\'t work.Started leaking one week after warranty expired.THis machine broke within a year a purchase.Only had it 5 Months and I have coffee pouring out the bottom.Did not work out of the box - based on call with customer support, this is a common problem. Would not recommend this machine to anyone who actually wants coffee.If you like luke warm coffee definitely get this machine. Google it. It\\'s a real issue.This thing takes twenty minutes to make a cup of coffee. And the coffee is like 50% foam. That\\'s before you add any foamed milk or anything. Impossible to get a normal cup of coffee or if this machine.The machine came cracked up. How do I get a new oneBroke out of the boxThis machine leaks coffee out the back, which creates a mess. Do not buy this machine. Others are much better.Play Video\\n I used this machine regularly, brewing no more than 1 cup of coffee a day. The Nespresso coffee would come out smooth and tasted amazing. I periodically cleaned the machine using factory settings and cleaning guidelines. However, 1 year to the date of purchase my machine started spewing coffee from the rear. A few ounces would pour from the rear and into the used pod basket. After some online investigation, I saw quite a few videos online with the same issue and within the same timeframe. There seems to be a consistency in machine malfunctions. It was good while it lasted. At this price point, I wish I got more than a year of usage.Doesn\\'t make a good cup of coffee or good espresso either.So this is nespresso\\'s newer line that uses the vertuoline of pods, which sorta sucks because you have to pay full price on nespresso pods. The original pods, and machines are actually good if you just drink espresso type drinks as they have generic pods, as well as starbuck and peets pods. But back to this machine, this new machine uses the an electronic activated lever in front, so you just pull up and it opens, you just tap on it down, and it closes, powered to open/close. Thats pretty cool, and this machine isn\\'t as loud as some video\\'s show, i was expecting like like crazy whirring noises, but it\\'s only slightly louder then the original machine. The water container is like double the size too of my essenza mini but this one does full coffee cup and if you buy the larger pods can do small thermos and larger travel mug sizes. So far i tried the odacio coffee, it was ok, smooth but flavor wasn\\'t my favorite. I tried the diavolitto expresso and that was excellent. In both i tried frothing Oatly (oat milk) with a half pack of sugar, in the aero3 frother, and it seemed to work fine, heating the oat milk to an acceptable temperature. For some reason it didn\\'t do well with the silk brand oat milk though, never got hot enough. I have purchased the nespresso melozio as well and will try that soon, which is another coffee mug type size pod. The machine does come with a sampler pack which i haven\\'t tried yet. But this machine does seem to output more espresso, compared to the original, and mainly i think because of the pod size, so if you don\\'t like small espresso shots maybe this machine will work better for you. Just remember you will pay full price for pods though. It might be more cost effective to do double shots on the original machine. So with that said, this machine has all the features of the old machine, but does everything larger, you can adjust water output just like the old machine, but this one has more automated features like the auto close and open for pod insertion. It also reads the pods barcode to know how much water instead of selecting the right size button, this machine only has one on button. It has a clean mode, and reset mode as well. The water tank can be moved from left, middle or right side which is interesting. The cup holder can be moved per cup size or taken off for tall mugs/thermoses. I currently marked flavor on 4 stars as i thought the coffee setting wasn\\'t as good, it\\'s a strong smooth coffee, but wish the flavors were better. Will comment more when i taste the other coffee pods. So for overall competition against keurig i give it a 5, as the quality surpasses keurig by a mile, but i\\'d minus a star just because of the pods costing so much. I expect the coffees to taste just as good for the price we\\'re paying per cup which is about 1.10 30 pods for 33 on amazon. So compared to SB, you\\'re still getting a deal, but wish the pods were a little cheaper. If you\\'re planning on making lattes, recommend getting the combo with the aerocinno3 frother, as it\\'s about 50 bucks bundled with the coffee maker, it\\'s 99 separate. The coffee machine has a 40% discount if you create an account, so it\\'s still cheaper to get the bundle.I bought in sale. It was marked down nearly all year. Than amazon prime day, it went up 20$. Wtf! But back down after the thrill of prime day, I grabbed it. A good quick espresso. But espresso is not a fast and easy beverage to make. Don’t judge espresso by what you get at Starbucks. Capsule espresso, next they’ll be having microwave TV dinners. Lol. But people demand instant over quality. All n all a nice little “espresso” machine. But will only use special mfr pods with bar code rims. The way it reads how much water it uses. ???\\n\\nUpdate . After time to use, and time to ponder this machine and need ton purchase Barcode only coffee Nespresso type pods , You can’t use any other pod but one with a barcode, Causing more trash in landfills, negating the ability to use a reusable pod. Though there is a standard reusable barcode pod for a specific amount of coffee. Make a set for different types. People are looking more towards recyclability, reuseable products now. Get with the program. This technology failed and should have stopped on the development end of production. Boo to delonghi for not considering this. If you have there would already be a variety of reuseable pod sizes.\\nThis is one of those worthless novelty products that are just a waste of any money’s spent, even when on sale.I hesitated on the Nespresso as some reviews have questioned the quality of the machine. I recieved an\\nAmazon gift card for my birthday, and decided to take the plunge. This makes superb coffee and expresso! I purchased a replacement policy but I have had zero problems with it. I enjoy a good cuppa of both coffee and expresso and this machine delivers. Try experimenting with the different paks offered: so far my 2 favorites are Giornio and the Vanizio for coffee and the Voltesso for expresso. A lot of folks complained about the cost of the pods. For great taste, I will pay the price! Still cheaper than Starbucks. The machine is fast and convenient to use.Obviously this makes a better cup than pot or Keurig coffee. But I think it rivals coffee from a legit espresso machine. My dad has a Saeco espresso machine that he spent close to $1,000 on and this little pod rivals it. I\\'m telling you this Nespresso machine does it right! I had my first cup at my boss\\' office when she kept telling me how great it was. When I saw the machine, I thought - yea, OK. I\\'m sure it\\'s good but it looks like Keurig\\'s baby cousin. I made a half calf and could not believe how good it was. Then I had a regular and I was convinced. It\\'s so creamy and rich - like you\\'ll find in Europe. All those George Clooney commercials are starting to make sense to me. I get it. I will never go back. The best part is they recycle their pods for free. So you can feel good about having 5 cups a day. I love this espresso machine. I enjoy my creamy coffee every afternoon more than anything. Thanks for selling such lovely product.We went round and round on which model to buy. We usually pick one of the higher models of products. We took a chance and went with the basic model. It has been great so far (2 months). My wife loves it. No cracks or leaks yet as others have reported. I think you just need to be careful when refilling the tank. Don\\'t be rough with it. Time will tell. I loveee this machine. Grant it, ive only had it for a week, but my wife and I are in love with it. With Covid-19 putting a damper in our plans to roam around and hang out at the coffee shop like we used to. Now we look forward to playing some coffe shop music in our kitchen, brewing some amazing Nespresso favorites, sitting and chatting our mornings away together. I HIGHLY recommend this machine. We have yet to try the frother yet but i\\'m sure it\\'ll only add to the awesome experience we\\'ve had so far. My ONLY complaint is that I wish this machine was able to take a universal capsule that we can fill our own favorite coffee with. This is really such a small desire being that we haven\\'t found a Nespresso capsule were disappointed with.The instructions are poor, though in many languages, but it is so simple to use, that with a bit of thought it is easy to figure out.\\nThe coffee is soooo good. I always worried about how much sugar I needed to add, but this is so good, I will be using little to no sugar from now on.\\nThe main thing I hate about coffee is the clean up, and this takes all the work out of it.\\nI couldn\\'t be more pleased.I love this machine except for the cost of the pods and the fact that our area grocers don\\'t carry them and I have to buy on-line. I bought one of those Geesta pod refillers and that works great and solved that problem and the problem of adding waste to the landfill or sending them in to be recycled. This machine makes a great tasting cup of coffee or espresso quickly. Tastes much better that the K-Cups.We adore Nespresso and this is our second machine for another location. It does the job the coffee is still delicious and consistent but the machine is loud and the reservoir is about half the size of our other machine. These are minor complaints. The coffee is great it I wish I had know these things before I bought this machine.This was a gift for my son and fiancé. I’m neither a coffee drinker or for that matter an Expresso person. The kids said I did a great job picking this exact one (thanks for the previous purchasers reviews)They wasted no time whipping up some Expresso’s with the sample pods that came with it. They love it!Bought machine in June. Now does not work. Can’t get any help after trying to trouble shoot all day. Never again!I own a Nespresso and I bought one for my granddaughter and she loves it. So it’s a hit. Great coffee, easy to use. The milk foamer is amazing, and so fun to use.I’m in love with my Vertuo Plus. I actually wake up earlier in the morning now because I look forward to my espresso. It makes my house smell wonderful and tastes amazing. I’m happy with my purchase so far.Easy to use right out of the box and the espresso is delicious! We had so much fun trying the sample coffee that was included and were able to choose our favorite from that. Best Christmas gift to ourselves ever!Have only had the machine for a few days and pretty upsetting that machine leaks while brewing, have placed paper towels under machine to catch spillage. Have tried cleaning around the seal, as some have recommended.\\nAlso tried the self-clean mode with no success. However we do enjoy the rich, bold flavors from the coffee.I barely got to use it and I wasted so many pods . Definitely not worth the hypIf you like black coffee it’s awesome! If you’re going to use a bunch of sugar and creamer might as well drink cheap drip coffee...Great coffee. Hard to tell which coffee you’re choosing. Although all the coffees are good.I got this after I purchased the new Next machine. The plus is way better in all aspects.\\nThe only complaint was that the coffee pods came expired.Purchased for my daughter with the Caramel and the vanilla pods. Better than coffee shop coffee! She loves it.I gave as a gift and she was thrilled! Works great. Recommend!Gave this to my grandson for Christmas We all love it !!I love love this machine! The coffee is so good that it’s almost impossible to go back to regular coffee. The taste and texture is unbelievable I don’t regret this purchase at all. You won’t either!Instructions were confusing - instead of have multiple languages on a page for each step - do a whole page for all the steps in each respective languageGreat coffee machine and the coffee taste great+++++NiceSiempre había querido una. No me arrepiento, me encanta.You need this espresso maker!! I love the different options of blends you have & plus it comes with samples to try several of them! It has been a saving grace in my life & saved money from less frequent Starbucks trips!The milk frother is a game changer honestly.Returned this item to exchange for black. Love the quality of this elegant machine.Play Video\\n I love my Machine it’s the best and will save a lot of money instead of going to StarbucksEasy to use clean, sleek great coffee optionsThis machine has changed my life! Aside from saving me money from the typical $5+ Starbucks flat white, the flavor and quality of these is exquisite! I recommend it 100%Great coffee maker. Easy to use and makes great coffee.Electric open and close is great touch. Makes fantastic lattes with the FrotherGreatI love this coffee maker. No need to buy coffee out anymoreNaGreat productAmazing!Love itI was cynical about this but it genuinely cutback my starbucks visits by a lot... I kill this machine in the winter.. the hot coffee is unlike anything I’ve had before... the crema is perfect! The aerocino is AMAZING for hot lattes and steaming the coffee creamer... I honestly wish I had purchased this years ago... once I learn to perfect the ice coffee and latte I dont see myself needing starbucks at all!It does good work on my coffee. Wish it could be hotter.We LOVE LOVE LOVE this machine. It isn’t as “fancy” looking as some of the more expensive versions, but we’re all about taste in our family. Still makes the coffee as amazing as you’d expect from Nespresso. And the milk frothing accessory is PERFECT. No more cooling my coffee with cold milk.My concern was whether or not the coffee would be hot… it is very hot… still experimenting with different pods… the only disappointment is the Kona coffee, was looking forward to at least a 7.77oz cup of coffee but ended up with 2 oz. Don’t waste your money on thisI really loved this coffee machine but it just suddenly stopped working after 2 months despite me going through the troubleshooting process multiple times.This is the second one and now am going to replace with something else at the higher end. Very frustrating.I like the fact that it works for espresso pods. If you use anything larger like a cup of coffee pod it floods out the machine. This product is faultyReceived as pictured - in a damaged box. It doesn’t appear that the product’s box alone offers enough protection against the rigors of shipping. Debating whether to return it or open and inspect for damage. Disappointing!\\n\\nUpdate 1/9/2022 to 4 stars. I decided to keep it and found that it was undamaged. It makes a great cup of coffee, espresso, etc.Simple to use . Impressive coffee.Easy to use, amazing flavor- wish I would have picked it up years agoA great addition to our coffee area, convenient and delicious.I purchased my Nespresso Vertuo Plus during Cyber Monday. Amazon offered the best price. It’s been a month so far, NO issues at all. It was easy to set-up and perform the first-time use cleaning. I don’t know how I survived before this machine. This machine is life. The coffee quality surpasses instant coffee (duh!). Exceptional price and quality. In addition, Amazon packed the product securely, so there was no damage during transit.I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves using this every morningAfter watching all the commercials for about a year I decided to buy the wife a Nepresso machine since we are both coffee drinkers and she expressed an interest. Now that we\\'ve had it for three weeks we cannot say enough good things about it. We love the variety of flavors, the convenience of having the servings in individual capsules and the ease of using the machine. One outstanding feature is that it really gets the water hot before going into your cup - no extra microwaving necessary....Exactly as described and very beautifulLove itWe are enjoying this so much. It brews an amazing, frothy delicious cup every time!Best coffee I ever had in my life. Easy to use, just fill with water, input your Nespresso capsule, push the button, and that\\'s it! The coffee tastes like the coffee I had in Europe at the Cafes in Stuttgart Paris, and Barcelona. Kerig coffee tastes like it\\'s watered down, it doesn\\'t compare to the Verto Plus Nespresso, which is a 20 out of 10! Worth every cent!great espresso with prefilled cupsGreat Christmas gift.This model offers many features. The touch of button to open and close top and a tap of button to begin a fine cup of coffee. DeLonghi is the brand & Deluxe is the model. All models offer “conservation” but the Deluxe is smaller on countertop and a flick of a button is nice even for one who does not have arthritis.Exactly what I expected!My second Nespresso machine and works very well. It is not bulky and easy to operate. I recommend it.It was a gift for my son\\'s birthday!! He said it made the best coffee !!I absolutely love the coffees that this machine makes. The froth is incredible and the variety of tastes makes it a fun journey. However, it is now April and I bought the machine in November and there is a 1 in 3 chance my 7.75 oz brew will only give me a 2 oz. brew. I use bottled water and I have run the machine 3x in a row with vinegar and I still get wonky brews. I am going to contact the company and see what can be done.\\nUPDATE I called espresso support and they very patiently walked me through how to reset machine. We did that and it works great and now I know how to problem-solve down the road. TIPS Use filtered water then you only need to descale every 6 months. The machine will tell you when it is time to descale. Do not push down on the button with the coffee cup light or the lever that opens the pod placement for very long. Tap and release. Keeping your finger there or double tapping either will reset the machine. ENJOY the best coffee ever!I bought this for my son, he is older. He LOVES IT! I wanted to get him something special. This did it! Works well and taste awesome! GO FOR IT!I love everything about this. 100%. Better than Keurig hands down 100%. Everything about this.Stayed at a friend’s house and used their Nespresso for a week. Bought one for ourselves as soon as we got home. Pods are a little spendy and I wish they would bring back the Alto (14 oz.) ones but the coffee is wonderful (good enough that we stopped using our Keurig machine).I love my Nespresso although after a few weeks my included frother started frother on to the counter. The rubber casket on the top doesn\\'t hold and allows the froth to run down the side.\\nAfter calling customer service and listening to 10 minutes of BS about how its my milk or milk level and the cap isn\\'t included in the warranty because its a spare part I hung up. I don\\'t know if this customer service agent represents the Company\\'s attitude toward customer service but for a 10. part after only six weeks it is a very petty approach to some that is buying a few hundred dollars in coffee a month. Ill buy my own lid from Amazon. Thanks for a lot Nespresso.We purchased this for our office and everyone seems to love both the coffee maker and the selection of different coffee flavors and types.I love it one of the best purchases I ever madeGreat life changing coffeeI’ve had a Keurig for years but wanted the convenience of making my own espresso at home. So far, this machine has done very well. It’s fast — even faster than the Keurig — not too noisy and the espresso tastes great. I use the smaller pods for a single shot of espresso. They aren’t the cheapest — this is the Vertuo line that has its own pods — but I only drink a shot in the morning so I don’t go through them that quickly. This model also comes with a milk frother if you want to use it. A nice convenience, and easier and cheaper than going to a coffee shop.This makes a really good cup of coffee or espresso. The only complaint is the pods are a little pricey. But nespresso recycles all their pods and will send you a prepaid bag to mail back the used ones.Absolutely PERFECT, delicious coffee and espresso drinks with warmed and frothed milk. I LOVE THIS MACHINE!! So easy to set up and use. Best Christmas present I ever bought myself!When it works, it makes great coffee. We purchased this in November of 2021 and have had the machine for just shy of three months. In the beginning, it worked fine but after about a month, it just stopped working and would blink Red when you tried to make a cup of coffee. At that point, I cleaned and descaled it and it worked again for about another week or so. Then, blinking red light again. Cleaned and descaled another time with no success. I called Nespresso customer care and we got it working, it made two cups of coffee and stopped again. I didn\\'t have time to call Nespresso so it sat on the counter for two weeks and we tried again and had coffee for two weeks. Then, the same issue. Nespresso is now sending us a replacement machine. This also happened to my daughter\\'s machine so beware this may be a common defect with the machine design. Also, make sure you clean it weekly and eject the cartridge after each use -- this was a tip from the customer care person at Nespresso.Love this machine for the flavor of the coffee that it gives of. No other machine makes it like Nespresso.Delicious Coffee. Milk frother does not create milk hot enough for hot chocolate but does it\\'s job.I love being able to place one pod in the machine, and have a perfectly fresh cup of espresso each time I brew one. It is easy, quick and tastes divine. The Aeroccino machine makes a delightful whipped topping if you wish and it makes the serving hot or cold based on your desire. PERFECT!Works well so far, makes good expresso and coffee, I\\'m pleased.I have been intimidated of buying this for so long. I really wish I had bought it sooner!Machine by De\\'Longhi is so much better than the one that Nespresso has. We have been through 2 Nespresso machines in a year. We got another one on eBay which worked once then quit. All of the Nespresso ones leak into the pod collection area and create a mess. The De\\'Longhi one has worked SOOOO much better and faster. We are very pleased with it. The coffee is very good. Our use of Starbucks has plummeted!I love the heavy quality feel of this machine. It’s too new to tell if will have issues like some reviews mentioned. I got it for my hubby for Christmas and he is loving the coffee. It comes with a variety of coffee choices kinda like a box of See’s Candy. We mostly use the Melozzio. We look forward to coffee that much more every morning. We were using a “Cuisinart Grind & Brew”, it’s great but the hassle of grinding and brewing an 8 cup carafe every day and the clean-up is not very practical. I have to say this is going cost about $90 vs. $25 per month. We may go back and forth between machines. It’s hard to find the pods in the store, but Amazon has them in stock. I probably should of got the one with the other pods style as they sell those at Costco. I recommend it.I love my Nespresso. I did have to look up instructions online because the ones in my box didn’t explain it super easily, but that wasn’t too hard. I bought my own milk steamer because the ones sold with some of these don’t get great reviews. The coffee is amazing and fast. Definitely worth the money.While this is not a barista level espresso machine, it’s pretty good for the price you pay.\\n\\nOne complaint I have is the flimsy and slippery cup stand/shelf. As the espresso is brewing, your cup will slide outward due to the vibration of the machine. If the shelf had a rubberized surface it wouldn’t be an issue.Coffee has never been so easy and delicious! This Nespresso machine is so easy to use and even empties itself after each cup of coffee. I love it!Gift for my daughter. She uses it daily. She said it is the greatest thing everLove the quality and the ease of use.I Love my 1st. Nespresso Vertuo Plus Coffee Machine that I bought through Amazon in December, 2018.\\nI decided to purchase another one & give the old one to my Daughter, since I will be moving to another place. We enjoy all sorts of coffee capsules that We both have purchase through Amazon as well directly online with Nespresso USA, these past years, they are the best!!! I know that the Vertuo Capsules can be very expensive using it on a daily basis, but it’s worth it!!\\nWe also have 2 other types of coffee machines @ home, but honestly, I couldn’t personally go back using them. It’s the best investment I have done and if you take good care of it, it will last a lifetime. Sincerely, MagdalenaI bought this Nespresso for the office, and already had the Verturo Next at home. This is inline with great quality products for Nespresso, and I have no complaints.\\n\\nOne neat feature on this model is the lid has a motor to open and close where you put the pod in rather than manually opening it. You simply push up on the front lever to open it, down to close it and in seconds you will have an amazing cup of coffee waiting for you.I have had my machine for a week now and I am obsessed! Super easy to use and super easy to clean. Makes the most amazing coffee, better than any coffee shop. Would definitely recommend, came super fast and packaged well. Love that it comes with a sample pack of coffee’s too.This Nespresso is delicious. Many different blends and all so delicious. Hot or cold, you going to love it.Item was returnedI wish I would’ve have listened to my colleague a while back and purchased this expresso machine much earlier!\\nI love it so much I look forward to mornings every day before work. I don’t think I can ever go back to drinking regular coffee anymore in my life. It’s very simple to use and coffee taste delicious. Although pods do cost more but hey, it’s still cheaper than going to Starbucks! Also, it’s good to treat yourself with some good coffee in this world we live in. I think we all deserve that. I totally recommend this machine trust me you won’t regret getting it. A great investment.I\\'m in love with my newest Nespresso ! Ahh such ease of use, wonderful aroma and delicious taste.Love the taste.The taste of the coffee is so much better than my keurig. I love thisThis stuff makes good crema and the flavor is strong. I frequently make iced and hot drinks with this and have use it every day, sometimes two times a day since I bought it.I’m not a coffee snob, but I do enjoy good coffee, and I think all the pods we’ve tried so far easily are way better than any Keurig pod I’ve ever had. Also the average price for the pods are right about what the keurig cups cost at my grocery store.\\n\\nI love that the machine will automatically adjust the volume by the pod size. But I think what I like most is the temp comes out hot enough that I can start sipping it without burning my tongue. With the keurig I’m impatient and always put 5 ice cubes in to drop the temp enough to drink it, but I don’t have to do that anymore, so I’m very pleased. The frother also works really well and you can do hot or cold froth. For the price and convenience I think this is an awesome machine, and currently kicks the crap out of our keurig.\\n\\nAgain I’m not a barista so I’m sure you can make better coffee with a grinder and some fancy way to brew it. But if you’re already using the keurig as your coffee method, this is way better!Easy to use, simple. I had a Nespresso espresso maker and I always added water to make an Americano. This machine makes a full 8oz cup of coffee which is nice and rich. It’s perfect.\\nI’m trying the different varieties but prefer the flavored pods.I\\'m just going to say that I love everything, it\\'s perfect! Early Christmas present for me. 🤍\\n\\n•I will update my review if anything changes.Love that Nespresso recycles the aluminum pods and the fast is awesome.I like this machine. It\\'s solidly built. It doesn\\'t feel cheap to me. It\\'s really easy to use and I like that it automatically collects the pods for you in it\\'s storage compartment. It\\'s super simple to use. You just fill up the tank with water, insert a coffee pod, then press the coffee button. It\\'s pretty quick and it brews the coffee nicely. I did have to exchange my first machine because it was not brewing so I was concerned these machines were finnicky and prone to problems. After I received my new machine I see now that the first was just an outlier and it overall appears to be a easy going well functioning machine.2 weeks in and I still love this machine. The ONLY complaint is that the frother won’t froth cinnamon powder into my milk.I always loved this coffee machine.\\nAnd will always be my favorite choice.\\nGive the exact espresso flavor.Never makes the same amount of coffee.Taste is different every time .Not always good.Purchased this machine to upgrade my 8 years old original Nespresso machine. I like how quiet it is and how fast it heads up! Coffee is very good as I am used to with my original line. Like the option to have 5 different coffee sizes (although I am a heavy espresso drinker) I went with this machine over a manual one mainly because of the speed, maybe some day I will have enough time in the mornings to perform a Barista. For now I am happy with my purchase.This is a great cup of coffee. All kinds and they are wonderful.Love this coffee....we have one at work and I had to have one of my own. No regrets...relax and indulge. Next to French press it\\'s my fave!Had an original Nespresso and wanted a newer machine. Decided to get a vertuo for the increased variety. After reading tons of reviews, I finally decided on the Vertuo plus. So far so good after a couple months of daily usage. A lot quieter then my previous machine and love the option to get double shots and full cups of coffee from 1 pod.I love this! Makes a great frothy cup of coffee, or espresso. Looks beautiful and coffee options taste great..WonderfulLove love my Nespresso! Love making iced coffee/espresso at home.SO MUCH FLAVOR.I\\'ve only had my Nespresso machine for a short time but I am IN LOVE with it already. I did watch a lot of YouTube videos instead of reading the pamphlets and it\\'s so easy to use! I also love the frother, it\\'s so easy to use and I can now make hot milk without having to use my stove/microwave. I also love that this machine has a self cleaning mode!!!\\n\\nThe only thing I have noticed is how loud the machine is. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m still getting used to this machine opposed to a Keurig, but it\\'s a very minor thing. Overall I still highly recommend this machine, and all of the flavors Nespresso has is just amazing so I\\'m excited to try them all!Nice and elegantThis machine has changed the way I do mornings. The coffee and espresso are amazing with so many options. Super easy to use. Really puts some pep in your step. Highly recommend!I have waited forever to pull the trigger on this...not sure why. SO GOOD, SO EASY. I was so sick of cleaning my coffee maker out!Play Video\\n Nespresso machine makes great coffee. Worked great for a couple of months and the day after I was able to return due to coffee leaking at back of unit when brewing coffee. Amazon amazing customer service accepted my request for a return. So impressed with Amazon. I do however really like the Nespresso VerteoPlus machine. I ordered another however I added the 4 year warranty. Hopefully I don’t have to use the warranty.\\n\\nUPDATE: After using the new VetroPlus for 10 months now... no issues at all.1ier fois que j\\'achète un article usagé Super satisfaite, je n\\'ai pas trouvé le défaut encore! et j\\'ai payé plus de 100$ de rabais. Super bon deal. A refaire pour d\\'autres achats.I bought this as a Christmas present. The machine was only used starting in January and was broken by the first week of February. The machine is leaking a giant puddles of coffee. Tried troubleshooting it with Nespreso and nothing worked. Can\\'t return it through Amazon and Nespreso won\\'t exchange it either.Very happy with this purchase. Makes good coffee, heats fast and the machine is very quiet comparing to others I had before. Would certainly recommend.This is our first Nespresso machine, but not our first coffee pod system. These coffees are far superior to other pod coffees and comparable to cafés. Easy to use, and the technology is very cool.Cannot believe that I just discovered the real taste of coffee. Great machine. Got for Christmas, cannot stop treating myself to another coffee.Seller does not respond! Machine has been leaking and only used for 3 weeks!!! Brand new and already not working properly. Leaks all over the counter (see photo) . Disappointed. Seller should stand by his products.Makes great coffee and espressoMe encanto!
