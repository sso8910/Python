If you're looking for a ""pod coffee maker"" that makes normal drip coffee (think Keurig) then Nespresso is somewhat different, and may or may not meet your expectations.

I also have a Keurig. It's just fine for brewing basic, cheap coffee (or more expensive if you buy major-brand-name capsules). I like my Keurig--we've had it for over 5 years, and it works great. But, those who are environmentally conscious will soon realize that Keurig is not recyclable at all, and countless billions of pods a year are making their way into landfills.

Nespresso's pods are made of 100% recycled/recyclable aluminum. Nespresso is VERY focused on a goal of 100% recycle-ability, and provides recycling bags with fully pre-paid shipping. Fill the bag (holds about 75-100 capsules), seal it, and drop it off at your nearest UPS store (or Nespresso store/kiosk if you happen to have one in a mall nearby). Nespresso will dismantle the pods, collect all the used grounds and process it into compost for landscaping use, and then melt down the pods and recycle them. 100% recycled!

All those recycling costs are already built in to the pod cost, so while these pods are more expensive than Keurig, there is ZERO waste as long as the consumer does their job.

The best way I can describe Nespresso is it's a totally new coffee ""experience."" Espresso or ""foo foo coffee"" lovers will likely be very pleased with this machine line. Folks who aren't impressed with anything beyond a drip cup may find Nespresso a little ""snooty"" for them.

Nespresso's Vertuo product produces coffee that is much more similar to a cup of espresso. The pods are spun at variable RPM's (typically 3000 - 7000RPM) and use ""centrifusion"" - a made up word intended to commingle ""centrifugal force"" and ""infusion"". Basically, they spin the pod, a pump squirts in water, and the spinning forces produce the coffee which is extracted and drips into the cup. It's not particularly noisy for a kitchen appliance, but you can definitely hear the spinning. Regardless of pod, they all come out with a layer of crema (coffee foam). There are (at the moment) five ""sizes"" of pods, which produce 1.5oz (espresso) up through 14 oz (""Alto XL"").

As with any product line, there are pros and cons. There are some fantastic things about Vertuo and a few limitations.

Pros: Absolutely fantastic coffee. All cups have a crema layer on them, and there are a relatively plentiful number of flavors and intensities available, ranging from lighter and fruitier/acidic flavors all the way up to very dark bold and smoky options. There are seasonal special pods as well, such as holiday blends or single-origin ""master"" type coffees. Pods and contents are 100% recyclable. Easy to use out of the box--there's ONE button. You press it. It works. Milk frother (optional add-on, included in our purchase) is FANTASTIC. I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but I use it with every cup! It's easy to use, and creates that ""latte experience""--it makes better lattes' than a certain really large chain whose name ends with ""bucks""--yeah, you'll spend 'em there. Pod cost, compared to an espresso shop brewing an equivalent latte for you, is cheap. VERY tightly-integrated recycling: drop pods in bag. Bag full? Seal it and drop it off at your UPS store. Pre-paid return shipping means zero-extra cost. Done. Milk frother is VERY easy to clean--takes about 15 seconds, if that. I've only owned the machine for a month, but the build and overall experience lends itself to belief this is a very high-quality unit. Excellent app (iOS/Android)---you can view/order/manage pods, accessories, maintenance/cleaning products and subscriptions right from your phone/tablet. Love a particular flavor? Just add it to your cart. It even supports automatic/routine replenishment if you want that. Seasonal and other specials show up in the app when available, making the app a one-stop-shop. Company is VERY plugged in environmentally and has created a coffee experience that doesn't fill a landfill. If you actually play the game the way Nespresso intends, it's a holistic coffee experience and a great one at that.

Cons: No third-party pods, and pods are relatively expensive when compared to other ""pod"" brewing standards. You want this machine? You'll be buying Nespresso-branded pods from Nespresso, or authorized resellers, and at full-tilt retail which typically runs about $0.90 for an Espresso pod and up to $1.20 for their normal coffees (some origins are as high as $2.00 a pod). So each cup is roughly double the cost of a Keurig brew. There are about 20 different pod flavors and five sizes available, so most people will find SOMETHING they like, but if you don't love one of the 20, you're out of luck as there are no 3rd-party options without ""hacking together"" a used pod, some self-ground coffee, and some foil cap stickers you found on the Internet.

Overall, this is an EXCELLENT machine for those who want more than a pod of coffee. I've owned it for a month and I'm 100% hooked."

I can back to write a review because of the quality of Nespresso customer service. The machine didn’t brew today and I called the support line after trying the online troubleshooting tips without success. My call was answered by a live, pleasant and helpful person after two rings! She used a one way video call to see the machine and walked me through a few different steps that fixed the issue. So refreshing!"

The machine is easy to use and the espresso pods are delicious. We used to get Starbucks every morning and we’ve saved so much money now that we use this machine. We make an iced caramel macchiato and it’s tastes better than Starbucks in our option. I’ve convinced both of my sisters to buy one and they love it as well! Would definitely recommend.

All the stars only have the new pod size (it's something with a ""V""), and I wanted the classic style.

Works great. Produces strong tasting espresso, and the pods are recyclable. What's not to like?"
11,11,별 5개 중 5.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2022년 9월 14일,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 타이탄.,"Moved to keurig not for the convenience but for the environmental impact. As long as the cups are recycled, it uses less energy and less water than the drip and bunn machines. That said, i had sacrificed a good cup of coffee for this. Then i was gifted a KCafe which includes the frother, and options opened up, but the coffee remained so so.

So, then a friend tells me about this beauty!! OMG!! Not only does it brew a strong, delicious cup of real coffee, the pods are fully recyclable- through the company. The machine has a lovely form factor, and is a pleasure to use!! It’s quiet, and quick. I’m no fan of Starbucks burnt coffee, i prefer my coffee tasty, and this was surprisingly smooth, nutty, and delicious.

Also, when you go to the website, there is a nice selection of flavors to choose from. And yes, you can get hot water from it (press the button three times). Would I recommend? Heck yeah.

Happy camper, trying to convince myself that a cup of coffee at 11pm is cool, lol.

7/22- just wanted to add! My aerocinno3 suddenly stopped frothing my milk this week, after months of working beautifully. I called Nespresso, and not only to I learn about my machine, but i also learned that sometimes a bad carton milk will cause issues. Here i am cursing the machine, reading all the negative reviews and then as soon as I swap to a new jug of milk... It's working it's magic again! I just wanted to stop by and encourage anyone who's skeptical- take a moment to do some digging, this machine is awesome and the support at the company is superb! Still a happy camper!"

The machine does all the work and it takes great. Super easy to use (just like a keurig), comes with samples and a coupon for $10 off their website of course. There are 3 different size pods/cups (espresso, double espresso and coffee), and the machine detects that and makes it with the correct amount of water. The pods are not too bad. Range from $10-$20 for a pack of 10 pods on their website. Perfect for an espresso martini too!"

I recycle the capsules and I compost the coffee. The Aeroccino is an absolute must. I have now tried many types of coffee. I have found those I’ve preferred but even those I haven’t have been excellent, just too strong for my taste. I LOVE the guide describing the intensity and other descriptors of the coffees, and they are on the mark. One critical comment: please consider shipping coffee in an unmarked box! I’m grateful no one took my box from my stoop while I was at work considering NESPRESSO was prominently displayed on the box."

The result is the perfect cup of expresso, cappuccino, or Americana, whatever your heart desires. The warmer/froth machine that came with it is exactly as amazing.

I have had nothing but great results and have not one negative comment about them... I read reviews that said the frother didn't make enough noise so he didn't know it was done - it has a light that goes on when you push the button to start it, and it goes off when it' s done. I find that the timing of making the coffee and milk frothing is almost exactly the same (open the unit, put new pod in, close unit and as it warms up to start, put milk in frother and the maker is then ready to go - start them both and they finish about the same time. I find that low fat milks froth just fine despite what other reviews have said (I use 1% most of the time). LOVE that it senses the ""size"" of the coffee/espresso pods and brews with the appropriate amount of water (you don't have to push a button to choose a size - but you can push the start button again if you want to dilute it). LOVE that the pods are recyclable and that the company provides postage free collection bags for that. LOVE the variety of coffees and espressos available (even by the mermaid brand), and last but not least, I get to think of George Clooney every morning as I make my coffee/espresso! P.S.

I did a lot of research and finally landed on this the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and I have to say this might have been the best purchase I have ever made! I needed something that would satisfy my ""boujee"" coffee lifestyle but still give my partner the ability to have his lam..... I mean normal coffee. The price of the pods, milk, and syrups are nothing in comparison to paying $5-7 for one latte 2-3 times a day.

Let me break it down (If you drink lattes every day):
- $3-5 for a gallon of lactose free milk that last me a week and a half or so
- $3-5 for vanilla syrup
- $1.5-3 for caramel or chocolate syrup (You don't need to get the high end stuff. I promise it almost all taste the same at the end of the day. You're just paying for the brand.)
- $0.87 for the pod depending on the one you get and if you get them in bulk (That can be recycled!)
- Reusable cups/straws
- No gas
- No waiting in lines

Seriously people. The hardest thing you'll have to do with all of this is find out what your favorite coffee roast is. And they even make that easy by providing you a sample box with like 12ish (can't remember off the top of my head) pods to try! My favorite is the small gold one. It's similar to the the Starbucks blonde espresso (which you can also buy pods of!)

Other perks:
- Super easy to clean
- Really easy to refill

Buy it. That's it. Just do it."

These are amazingly fresh and sealed so that the coffee tastes way better than K-cups from Petes or Starbucks. The machine is fast and even discards the pods into a container so it doesn't stand around all day, with the taste of the old and used grounds going into your next cup. The coffee will be a bit pricier and you will have to reorder from their website. It will average around $1.00-1.30 per coffee or espresso. But to be honest, to get this quality of coffee this fast right at your place is well worh it. I've had world famous coffee for example in Colombia, and their stuff is pretty close, obviously not as if you're there but the taste is surprisingly good. Can't go back to K-pods, ever.

44,44,별 5개 중 1.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2022년 8월 19일,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 블랙,"UPDATE: I went for a Keurig K-Supreme Plus instead and it's one of the best things I've ever purchased! I am absolutely in love with it (and I don't usually get so enthusiastic about things that I've purchased)! Delicious coffee within seconds every morning – it actually makes me look forward to morning time, and so much variety!! It probably sounds like I'm affiliated with Keurig but I'm not, and I'm not being paid for this review. I just don't understand why Nespresso has such a following (I had tried this out because a friend told me that it's waaay better than Keurig, and that is definitely not true).

High-level faults before getting into the fraud/scam details:
1. It is very difficult to use. I work in tech, and love tech gadgets. With this thing, it's ridiculously difficult to figure out how to make a cup of coffee. I had to watch numerous YouTube videos. The amount of different combinations of button presses for each different function is just crazy. For example ""tap the coffee button three times within 2 seconds, hold two buttons for more than 3 seconds, then tap the coffee button to confirm. Then a green light will flash three times, followed by a solid orange light..."". I can pretty much guarantee you won't even be able to open the machine to put a pod in there without watching a YouTube video.
2. There is a VERY limited selection of coffees. While every coffee company out there makes pods for Keurig machines, Nespresso machines read a barcode on each pod, and will not do anything unless the pod is from Nespresso or Starbucks.
3. The coffee is just meh. I don't know what all the great reviews are about.

Now for the fraud part – seriously, there's a whole reddit thread about suing Nespresso for this:

I received my Nespresso Vertuo Plus today and was very disappointed to find out (after a lot of frustrating, time-wasting troubleshooting and researching) that the largest coffee it can make is 7.7oz, even though Nespresso says this machine can make up to 14oz coffees. However, Nespresso has discontinued the Alto/XL pods that are required to make 14oz coffees, but they still say everywhere that they can make up to 14oz. The whole reason I decided to give Nespresso a try is because they very loudly market the fact that this can make large cups of coffee (like a Keurig can), but it's literally not possible in this machine because when it reads a barcode on each pod, it uses the amount of water that's recommended for that pod. So, without the Alto/XL pods (which no longer exist, but you won't see that update in any of their documentation or YouTube videos), you cannot make a coffee that's larger than 7.7oz unless you use multiple pods, which would be stupid because the pods are already more expensive than their competitors. Nespresso even has a YouTube video that shows how to make a large cup of coffee in this machine by manually programming the amount of water to use. I tried this with one of the other pods (not Alto/XL), and even though I kept my finger on the button like they said, it still stopped at 7.7oz. They should clearly say that you can only make a maximum of 7.7oz because they no longer support the 14oz pods.

Final thoughts:
I'm originally from Europe but I've lived in the US for a few years. When I go into a coffee shop in the US, it's most common to see people ordering at least 12oz or 16oz coffees. Tiny little coffees are great in Europe, but Nespresso is being really stupid for making the majority of their machines not cater for the US market, which is one of the biggest markets in the world for coffee consumption."

50,50,별 5개 중 5.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2022년 5월 21일,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 블랙,"I'll preface this review by stating that I am an espresso drinker. I have an automatic espresso machine, which I love, and that is the bar I used for my comparison. I will say that the coffee produced by this machine is as good as the coffee from my expensive espresso machine.

I like the option of a quick coffee for some variety. I have had Keurigs for years, and am probably on my 5th rendition. The more I drank espresso, the more dissatisfied I became with the Keurig. I found myself having to use 2 k-cups to get one cup of coffee strong enough for my liking. I then saw the nespresso online, and began to research the machine. Although there are minor complaints about it, the majority of reviews were positive, so I decided to buy one.

I was torn between the older model and the vertuso model. The attraction of the older model is 3rd party coffee pods, which saves money but after watching many a youtube review, it appeared the vertuso produced a better coffee with more crema. I opted for the vertuso plus deluxe. The deluxe model has a larger water tank and chrome accents.

The machine was simple to set up. Just fill the water tank, plug it in, make sure it had a container under the spout, and it went through a priming/rinsing cycle. The machine comes with 12 sample pods, each different. I immediately made a coffee and it was amazing! The flavor was excellent. It was more impressive than my expensive espresso machine (likely due to my choice of beans). I've since had several drinks from the machine and am pleased with each. The machine knows the right amount of water, brew time, brew temp for each pod, due to the bar codes. I no longer need to use 2 k-cups to get a decent cup of coffee, so the price per cup ends up the same as the Keurig. I spent about $.50 per k-cup, and each nespresso capsule is about $1. The brew time is longer than the Keurig, but shorter than my espresso machine (however, my machine grinds the beans for each cup).

I love this machine. I immediately ordered more sleeves of pods from nespresso's website. My order was shipped the next day and arrived 2 days later! Also, the machine comes with a $10 coupon for pods and you get samples with each order.

This machine is fantastic. I have given it 5 stars. It is worth the price, if you like quality coffee. Not even Starbuck's makes a better espresso! Buy it!"

Read a few reviews that said the coffee wasn't hot, which held up my purchase, however it is every bit as hot as my Keurig. The milk frother is excellent, if you use half and half there isn't any liquid at all, all froth. As good as Keurig is, it can't hold a candle to this. Just making regular coffee it's great. A little pricey for a home brew, but a quarter of the cost as Starbucks, and is just as good, if you really get into it with flavors and technique, you can beat Starbuck's Latte's and cappuccinos hands down.

I do wish pods weren’t so expensive or nespresso would make reusable ones but overall I have no complaints. With the frother I honestly could live without it. It overflows easily and won’t just heat the milk. There is also no option for amount of froth.

I finally decided to treat myself and now I’m obsessed with coffee. I look forward to waking up to get my espresso fix, and sometimes I even sneak another cup when I get home from work. It’s just completely changed the game for me and I love that they give you a sample pack. The quality of the coffee is just incredible and I’m thrilled with it.

Those are the pros, but there are SOME cons.

This particular machine worked flawlessly the first couple of uses but now the button isn’t quite responsive and it takes a moment or two for it to start brewing. By that, I mean I thought maybe the water was low, so I went to fill it and half way through filling it the machine started brewing. It was a mad dash to turn it off.

Next, there’s the matter of the pods. More so the attainability and availability of them. Williams Sonoma sells the original line but for some reason Nestle hasn’t released the the vertuo line to them yet, which, suffice it to say, is stupid.

Shipping an online order directly from nespresso takes a minimum of 3 business days for my location, which, maybe I’m spoiled by amazon, but not a fan of that.

Aaaaaand, seasonal creations sell out FAST, so you gotta pay attention to those emails, folks. Don’t sit on them.

Also, Nespresso boutiques are hard to come by. I live in a major metroplex and there’s only one about 90 minutes from me. If they’re going to be stingy about how many locations they have, why not allow Williams Sonoma to handle some of that retail?

Bottom line, it’s DECADENT coffee but it’s a bit of a pain in the ass to obtain."

Well, I've had my machine since Christmas (gift to myself) and I've had no such problem. I've been enjoying my coffee ritual so much now that I also bought a milk frother, but not the nespresso branded one as that seems too expensive. I love that I can make any coffee drink I desire. I love the different size pods, and how you can program each pod size to brew a certain volume of coffee. My favorite pods are the alto pods, which is new with this machine. And I love that I can feel good about having ""pod coffee"" again with their pod recycling program.
Now, about descaling. Last week, I descaled my machine for the first time and had no problems and the coffee is back to tasting like new. I thought the machine would warn me when it needed to be descaled, but 5 months in I never got the warning and figured I better be proactive. I've been using filtered water in the machine, so maybe that held off some of the buildup. I find coffee tastes better with filtered water anyway.
But, the machine was getting noisier, and the coffee was starting to sputter when coming out of the spout, so I thought it might be time to descale. So I used one of their descaling packs and followed the directions in my manual. The machine did its thing and now I'm back to like new operation with less noise again and more flavor for about a week. I wonder if perhaps the problems people had are because the machine's setting lets the buildup get too bad before prompting you to descale.
Last tip is Nespresso has a wide range of coffee profiles, so I suggest trying sample packs (and always ordering your free 2-pack when ordering pods on the Nespresso site) to find the right flavor profile for you. I love this machine and love having my morning coffee now!"

I am a coffee drinker and I am fine with using instant coffee throughout the day. This is good when I am craving that good coffee in the afternoon or in the evening after the end of my work day. We have stopped craving Starbucks coffee because of this.
Love the ease of operation and the size. It is much smaller than a Keurig machine and looks great in the kitchen. Also I love that you can recycle the coffee pods by sending the used coffee pods to Nespresso in a postage paid envelope. I love this easy method. With Keurig, although you get recyclable pods, you have to separate the coffee, throw it in the regular trash and then dispose the remaining pack in the recycling bin. With this, you dump all the used pods in the postage paid envelope, pack it once its full and drop it at a nearby UPS.
The only downside if the cost of the pods. It comes to approximately a dollar to $1.5 per cup depending on the coffee and the deals/coupons you get. But this is gourmet coffee and something I drink only once a day (twice if I had a long day). For regular coffee, the instant coffee works for me.

When I received the package I felt like it was Christmas morning! I couldn't wait to open it up and drink as much coffee/espresso that I could. The machine is very sleek and doesn't take up much room. It also came with a milk frother which has been a game changer!! Not only does it make hot foam but you can also make cold foam for your iced drinks. I definitely feel like a barista in my own kitchen! They also provided a sample pack of nespresso pods. It was kind of like coffee roulette. My husband and I would pick different pods and then determine which we like best. The only downfall I have noticed so far is the availability of the pods. A chunk that we did like or want to try were out of stock on the nespresso website and besides Amazon, the only place I have found them so far are at a few select target stores (I heard bed bath and beyond has them too but have not gone yet). Overall this purchase has not only made me feel like a kid with a brand new toy but it's also been saving me money since I barely go to Starbucks now."

Review of Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi with Aeroccino, Grey
PROS
The coffee tastes better than starbucks or anywhere that makes it. It creates a frothy foam on the top of the coffee and really makes it an excellent cup. This is about 10x better than kureg as far as taste. Initial setup was easy out of the box. First cups were perfect and the machine made them without issue.
CONS
After about 2 months we have run into a few problems. The machine does not consistently work and continues to throw out the error code of ""no water"" or ""water container empty"" even when there is water in it. See the video for proof. After about 10-15 attempt it works and makes a cup. Luckily it doesn't reject the pod and it can be reused (even though it doesn't really even use it). Note this doesn't happen every time and usually it is the 2nd cup of the day that we end up fighting with the machine on. The other major complaint I have about this machine is precisely the way it tells you the error code. There is no display which code show a code. In stead you have to watch the flashing light and count how many red or green lights flash and how long they stay eliminated. Then you have to use the manual to look up the red/green code. Why can't you just have a $2 display that shows the status of the machine...WOW! What century are we in...lets make the error code reading as complicated at we can that way the user has to guess at the actual problem. Come on nespresso! Even a $5 calculator has a digital display. OK, back to the issue. As you can see on the video there is water in the carafe yet the machine continue to through an error. We are getting more and more frustrated by the cup. I will leave the rating at 3 stars but only because the coffee is so damn good.... when it does create a cup full.

UPDATE 5/11/2019
Ok. Now we are going down to 1-star (from 3). The machine makes the first cup every morning just fine. The 2nd cup NEVER works. The ""refill water"" light flashing comes on after you press the button to start the 2nd cup. I called customer service at Amazon and because we are over the 30-day window (actually 35) Amazon won't take it back. They patch me into Nespresso hot-line and then Nespresso wants to troubleshoot the problem, all over again. After talking to two people at Nespresso and arguing over what the red flashing light means and actually reading the manual to the Nespresso person on the phone she finally agrees to ""repair"" the machine. At first she wanted to ONLY send an empty UPS box so the machine could be sent to be ""repaired by a technician"". She told me that process would take about 2-weeks. I told her that was unacceptable and I needed coffee. She reluctantly agreed to send a ""loaner"" machine that we could use while our machine is ""being repaired"". After an hour with her on the phone I was ready to give up. It was apparent she had a ""protocol"" that she had to follow in order to reduce the returns and get customers to give-up because their customer service process is too complicated or there is too much push-back from the representative. I'm overall very disappointed with Nespresso and wish I would have purchased the machine at the local target. At-least then I could just take it back or buy another one and then take this one back. Nespresso you need to whole-heartedly stand behind your product for greater than 35 days and not give your customers the run-around. Think about how many people I'm going to tell about my experience with your product and the poor customer service. Also, add a digital display to the machine, it can't cost more than a free calculator display. A real code to read instead of a flashing light to count flashes like morse code would REALLY help your customers AND your customer service representatives in troubleshooting the errors...DUHH!"

112,112,별 5개 중 5.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2022년 5월 7일,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 그레이,"Just a week prior to this purchase I bought the original espresso only nespresso not realizing there was a version that brewed coffee. I quickly returned that purchase and bought the vertuoline.

There are two versions / manufacturers of the nespresso vertuoline--- 1) DeLonghi (this one) and 2) Breville. I chose the DeLonghi version exclusively for the swivel water tank feature. Aside from this functional difference they appear to be identical aside from design appearance. I'm really glad I went with this one as it really comes in handy having the tank on same side as sink. I've even moved the machine to opposite side and swiveled the tank to accommodate it.

Its important to note that this machine uses vertuoline size round pods ONLY. You cannot view the small espresso capsules. There is a line of espresso capsules that fit this machine however the selection is more limited than the original Nespresso line (it is however growing).

Before purchasing I read many reviews which mention a problem with the water temp being too cool. This comes down to preference- I would say this pumps out sufficiently hot coffee for my liking. I noticed the second consecutive cup brews a bit warmer than the first cup (maybe the machine warms up). Nespresso told us that you can prime the machine by brewing a cup of plain water first-- this hasn't been necessary -- my hubby prefers his coffee extra hot so I always brew my cup first and his second. He's had no complaints and doesn't need to microwave it for additional heat.

The frother is also great- Try using low fat or no fat milk for the best front. I tried half and half and it doesn't foam near as well. I wish the container had a lip to pour from but that's my only feedback.

I seen a Nespresso demo years ago at Target and I wish I had taken the leap sooner. In the bay area I had a daily Philz coffee 4$ day habit and I haven't been once since this purchase. My favorite capsule is the Giornio. Add a splash of heavy whipping cream for perfection. Brews with a beautiful foam on top. Perfection!"

The Nespresso brand coffee pods are high quality, flavorful, and there is enough variety available to suit every taste. I haven't found anything that I don't like about the machine. I purchased the one with the milk frother because that is something that I enjoy.

Some of the reviews stated that the coffee was not hot. With the frother, you can froth your milk or cream. If you don't like froth, I would just microwave my cream in the coffee cup to heat it a little before brewing the coffee or just microwave the cup for a few seconds to take the chill off.

The Nespresso recycling program is especially easy and attractive for the consumer. The pods, in which the coffee comes, are aluminum. The company supplies free recycling bags which are already prepared with shipping label and shipping fee. All you have to do is put the used pods in the supplied bag, close (bag is self sealing), and drop at UPS. Easy peasy. When you order your coffee pods, if you need recycling bags you add them to your shopping cart for free. I love how this company has made recycling of their product easy and seamless for the consumer."

They will have you go through the long-drawn-out cleaning, and doesn't fix a thing. They want you to empty the pods each time. Don't leave them in the catch container, or they will drip.

EDIT: Flavors, oh man, you have to try the Caramelizio, Bianco Leggero (over milk) and the Bianco Forte (over milk)

Makes good coffee, I'm still searching for the perfect flavor, but the machine itself is a work of art. I love the mechanical head lifting and how it disposes of the used capsule to it's container held in the back. It's actually pretty high-tech, so if anything malfunctions, there is an easy way to reset it without issue.

Your machine may need to be reset to its factory settings, to correct the amount of water dispensed through your capsules. To return to factory settings, we recommend the following steps:

Tap the lever upward, to eject any used capsule from the capsule chamber, then tap the lever downward, to close the head of the machine.
Push the lever down for approximately 3 seconds, until the green light goes out, to turn off the machine.
Press and hold the coffee button and lever down, simultaneously, for approximately 3 seconds, until the light is steady orange, then release the lever.
Press the lever down 3 times. The light should start blinking quickly in a pattern of 3 blinks and a pause.
Once the blinking pattern is established, press and release the coffee button.
The light will blink 3 times slowly, to confirm the reset, then turn a steady green."

First of all, there is one button, and one button only, that will flash to express what is happening. Fine, except there are about 40 different color/speed combinations and you need to figure out the difference between a fast blinking red light and a rapid blinking red light.
If you only want the same type of coffee every single day, this machine is perfect. There’s one button, and it’s easy and clean. However, if you ever want to switch the size of the cup you’re having or switch another function, it’s about an hour of clicking a single button, diagnosing a blinking light, and experimenting to see if you got it right.

It takes a while to sort though all the flavors to find one that is acceptable, not necessarily better than other coffee brands. Additionally, you have to get used to foamy coffee, similar to a latte. If you put cream or milk in your coffee, the coffee temperature may be too cool. The directions indicate that you should put the milk in first and stir the mixture when ready. However, I still need to put the cup in the microwave for 20 seconds to obtain a hot cup of coffee. Finally, the cost of the pods is more than I expected. Each pod costs $1.00 +. There is also a difference in the amount of coffee provided per pod. Unfortunately, the flavor my husband likes only provides a half a cup of coffee. You have to consider the flavor as well as the size of the pod in making a selection. He also has to add sugar to improve the flavor, which he had not needed to do before. Therefore, the cost-value benefit of this system may be an issue depending on your coffee preferences. I found that there are just too many usage restrictions and adaptations. I suggest that you view the YouTube presentations before buying or using this coffee system for the first time. There is a link on the Nespresso website. The videos are very good and will help in understanding how this system works. Additionally, Nespresso's customer service and delivery system are excellent. They do provide a wide variety of flavors and coffee types."

My only complaint is the milk frothier is missing one of the whisks. Since I’ve been using the machine and don’t want to deal with the hassle of returning it I’ll have to reach out to the seller to see if they will ship a whisk to me.

I first tried Nespresso at my friends and liked it but wanted a larger quantity than an espresso. I didn’t know that there are machines that brew larger quantities, 8oz and 14oz.

Yeah it’s not as cheap as brewing a cup of coffee but I wasn’t doing that either. Instead I was buying a cup every day at work for $2. So for me it’s cheaper.

I have to say the coffee is much better tasting than Keriug, not sure if I spelled that correctly, and Starbucks.

The machine is very easy to use. Push up on the lever to open, the motorized lid opens, drops the spent pod at the same time, install the new pod, press down on the lever to close, and push the button at top to start.

The milk frothier is extremely easy to use. Pour in the milk to one of the two fill lines, close and press the button. Since I only have the one whisk I’ve only filled it to the lower level and frothed hot milk for hot drinks. I haven’t used it yet, but if you press and hold the button for 2 seconds you can froth milk for cold drinks. Hot the button flashes red and cold it flashes blue. Pretty smart.

If you are considering this machine, what are you waiting for?

Update 12/17/17: The instructions are not the most detailed, but I did notice that the provided whisk can be converted by removing the spring. In the lid there is a spring storage bracket when you are using the whisk without the spring. Therefore, the package came complete and I’ve upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I thought it was short one whisk."

I bought this machine almost a year and a half ago and it is great. We also bought the glass stand/capsule holder at the same time. We love coffee in our home and this machine is especially a plus when you have guests and everyone likes different coffees. It makes an easy fabulous cappuccino with the frother. We use a standard coffee machine to brew a pot of coffee every morning and use this for our afternoon coffee fix. I don’t think the pods are expensive considering they cost an average of $1.00 each and you can’t get an espresso or cappuccino for less than $3-$5 and a regular American cup for almost $2. You also have many pod options for strength and taste so there is something for everyone. It is definitely a good buy.

The unit is much quieter than the Nespresso Pixie Espresso Maker I have and it heats up more quickly. For early morning use the Pixie is loud enough to wake up a light sleeper. That is not a worry with the new machine.

I like the option to make full size cups of coffee and the selection of pods that came with the machine was varied enough to help me find the flavors I enjoy best. I will keep using the Pixie for espresso until the Veturoline espresso sized pods find a lower price-per-cup.

I do think the price per Veturoline pod is high but that does not detract from the machine.

I have read some reviews about a problem with scaling. I only use distilled water in all of my coffee machines and although I have only had this machine for just over 5 months, I have used my 1st Nespresso machine almost daily for over 2 years and I have not experienced any scaling issues with it.

The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi is a good machine and with a fair price. It is easy to use and easy to clean and has a larger water reservoir than expected. If you are interested in trying the Veturoline pods I recommend this machine."

My main issues come from the machine itself. It is already malfunctioning and I’ve not had it even HALF a year yet. I’ve had it maybe 2-3 months. When I put the pod in it won’t let me make the coffee. I’ll put the top down and it’ll continue beeping green so then I have to take the pod out and reinsert and I’ll have to redo this process 3-4 sometimes more until it works. This means I’ll have to take the back off so I can catch the pod before it goes with the used ones. It’s just a hassle and not what I expect from a brand new coffee maker. Today was the final nail for me writing this review as I opened the machine to make coffee today and yesterday’s pod got STUCK on top so I had to remove the back (which had only one used pod in it as I just cleaned it) and then it fell and I was able to put the new pod in and go through with the stupid putting it in, closing machine, having to reopen and catch the pod before it goes to the back, then replace it, hope it works or continue this cycle till it does. I like the coffee this makes and I’m just so bummed by the quality of the machine."

It took me a very long time to choose a coffee machine and I'm glad I settled on this one. I no longer had (and still don't have) the time to use my Bialetti, so I needed something to get me good coffee fast and easy with minimum effort and that's what this machine gave me. Having read the reviews I was worried about leaking, but I thought occasional leaking was better than underheated coffee every time (like with some other Nespresso machines), because it at least can technically be fixed. But no fix needed, my machine does not leak a bit.
I like Aflorazio cups made with stevia and Nutpods vanilla oat creamer (I have a different brand of frother that I had purchased before my Nespresso) - makes great latte! Gives me something to look forward to every morning especially now that we have to mostly stay indoors due to the virus and so much smog."

I always wanted the kind that made coffee too but they were simply too expensive in the past for me to consider.

Finally got one, and love it! I was a bit worried because apparently some of this line leak, but I have had zero problems with mine so far (I've had it about a week). I realized that because I usually make a morning latte that has two espresso shots in it (ie. two of the capsules) I would be better off with a machine that makes coffee too, so I got this one. I LOVE the coffee. Make no mistake: this machine is NOTHING like a keurig, and if you like keurig coffee, this is NOT for you. This machine makes strong, lucious coffee with crema on the top, which I love, and it also makes espresso. If you regularly go out for coffee at a place like Starbucks or somewhere else that makes fancy coffee drinks, you'll love this, but if you're after the kind of insipid drink that passes for coffee in a lot of the US, this will not be for you. I had given up on drinking drip coffee completely, because it's usually not strong/tasty enough for me, so I alternate between making a cold brew myself and this machine, and it keeps me going.

One small nitpick: I actually like the espresso from my old machine a bit more, because my old one had no auto-shut off, and I could adjust the strength of the espresso to my own purposes. I also prefer a bit less crema on my espresso than this makes. But it's a mild complaint.

I'm in love with this machine!"

This one came with a pod sampler pack which was delightful. I promptly used my promo code included in the box and ordered 50 pods. The pods are VERY expensive (80 cents to $1.80). Hopefully their patent expires and opens up more options eventually. A lot of reviews said the coffee maker was quiet, but i wouldn't call it that, you can definitely hear it and i would say that it's actually kind of loud. The milk frother is my favorite part - do not get the maker without the frother. Half and half works best, and it even heats up the creamer to a pretty hot temperature. If you're on the fence about getting this, i would say definitely expect to pay more for coffee overall, but it's the price you pay for getting into the Nespresso Club."

UNTIL a friend of mine just made me an espresso from this Nespresso machine! It was insanely delicious! Full of flavor and BOLD and there are so many options to choose from when it comes to pods and picking out a flavor and delivery on Amazon in Los Angeles is same day delivery and you can order on the Nespresso app as well!

To me if you are questioning this machine and to a Keurig, just forget about the Keurig all together you'll be disappointed in the long run and will eventually buy a Nespresso machine.

Price break down for buying pods is $1.10 each when you buy 1 sleeve of 10 pods.

Thats cheaper than a cup of coffee from McDonald's just saying this machine will save you tons of money and will most likely not have you caring about Starbucks or Coffee Bean when you can simply make the same cup of coffee for less at home."

I have to admit I was surprised that the quality of coffee was markedly better, smoother in texture, and the coffee capsules that I've tried thus far (melozio and Columbia) are better in taste. I haven't had any of the issues of the coffee not being hot enough, so not sure what those reviews are about.

The coffee produced has a sort of espresso style crema which I did not know was a thing (I'm not a coffee snob, I just like a solid cup of coffee). Pictured is my likely mishandling of the aeroccino, still trying to figure out how to get maximum froth.

Also, I like that nespresso can be recycled (have to get bags and then drop that off at a ups store) so if you want to save the planet you can

Let's start with the ease of use of this espresso machine. You press the top coffee button and the machine warms up, the green light becomes steady and it's ready to brew. Put in your favorite capsule and close the top lid and press the coffee button. Did I mention the motorized capsule lid? The lid opens and closes itself with a touch of the lever and disposes the capsules into its bin on the back of the machine.

Milk frother is even easier to use. Just pour the milk in and press the button. Adding the froth of milk makes you feel like a real barista! You can totally make the same exact drinks as they make at Starbucks for the fraction of the cost. And the drinks are super strong depending on which intensities you choose.

I paired this machine with double-walled coffee/espresso cups also purchased on Amazon. Much better than your everyday ceramic cups so you can see what you're drinking and the art you just created in the cups. I also purchased the storage drawer holder for capsules that stores the capsules and machine on top (see pics)!

This is like any other home appliance. You have to upkeep things like this. Clean it. Maintain it. If you don't do any of these things, things will eventually break. And for the people that gave this product 1 star, return it if it's broken?"

Prior to purchasing this coffee machine- I did my fair share of research. Something that particularly stood out to me that made me want to purchase the product that made it unique to other coffee machines, is that it uses barcode recognition and a brewing extraction system. There is a different barcode for every different coffee type on each capsule and the machine adjusts the flow and volume of water, temperature, infusion time and capsule rotation to make the best coffee.

The unit is quite sturdy mechanically. It's a bit confusing trying to get it to run the descaling process every few months. That's partly when the electronics started acting funny.

That said - I could not recommend this product. I gave 2 stars because it's actually a good product when it actually works, but our 1st machine and 2nd machine both started to leak internally.

PROS:
Easy to use
Coffee is delicious
Good selection of flavors on nespresso.com
The coffee pods are recyclable; nepresso.com even sends you self-addressed envelops to send back the used pods, free of charge.

Note: I've never used or tasted a Keurig so I can't compare with other similar machines. I've had the a Mr. Coffee for the past 10 years and only switched to Nespresso after glowing reviews (and an Amazon sale).

CONS:
Leaks after a few months!!! Our 1st machine leaked, our 2nd (replacment) also leaked!

We've bought the Nespresso Virtuo Plus back in December 2019 since it was on sale on Amazon.
After about 3 weeks, it started leaking at the bottom. It seems like the there was a clog somewhere inside the machine so coffee would get backed up and overflow. We did the recommended cleanings and descaling cleanings as well, but that didn't help.

We did an exchange with Amazon and got the replacement end of January 2020. It was working beautifully, we did the recommended cleanings as per the manual's schedule. It started leaking as well in middle of May 2020,, same issue as the 1st machine.

Since it's still covered under warranty (1-year manufacturer warranty), we called Nespresso customer support and they walked us through some troubleshooting (use a toothpick to pick out clogs, do a clean cycle with hot water) but it still leaks, so they are sending us a box so we can send back the Vertuo Plus so they can fix it and send it back. We are potentially without coffee for about 3 weeks so we will be using Mr. Coffee in the meantime to fill the void.

Honestly we are expecting the 3rd machine to eventually break, which is a shame because this is a great machine when it works. It's hard to go back to Mr. Coffee that we are willing to put up with this product as long as the warranty covers replacements but I do not recommend this product.

I think alot of the positive reviews are from users who may not have come back to update their initial 4/5 star reviews.

Please try googling ""Vertuo Plus leaking"" as well."

What's Vertuoline coffee you ask? Well, it's these newer giant pods from Nespresso. When I bought this machine, I should have better educated myself, because these things are both rare and expensive comparably to K-Cups etc.

The good is that the coffee it does produce is excellent. Tastes good, high caffeine (if that's what you're into) and just works. It expels the pod neatly into it's little trash bin behind it, which is good for an office setting like ours. It also heats up relatively quickly compared to Kcup machines we've had in the past. It also uses aluminum pods, which for those BPA-phobic out there, I'm sure is a very good thing and perhaps worth the premium. Machine also looks good, is easy to clean, and works perhaps too simply, literally it's so simple that people get confused operating it.

The bad is expensive pods that are hard to find. Also we still haven't figured out how to get it to dispense just hot water for tea, hot cocoa, etc. When we do, it goes into ""cleaning"" mode and dispenses pretty much all the hot water.

Anyways, we got the machine on sale, it makes good tasting coffee so it's worth it for some. I wouldn't buy it again or necessarily recommend it for the simple reason you're locked into their rare Vertuo line crapola. If this somehow becomes as mainstream as Kcups, then cool, but I've seen no sign of that and quite honestly the opposite. For the price of the Vertuo line pods, you're pretty close to a cup at McDonalds/Sbux to begin with, so it's hard to justify the expense."

In the meantime I have developed such a love for my daily cappuccino with whipped milk or cream that I can't stop thinking about my Nespresso coffee machine when we are out of town. even on vacation I look forward to getting home so I can enjoy my love (addictive) Nespresso coffee.
any way I can get some free pods ????

I've only had it a week but I'm in love. I was paying $4 a day for my coffee habit prior to purchasing this machine so the cost of the pods don't bother me and I really enjoy that there's essentially no clean up.

This is the second Nespresso machine I have owned. The first was the original machine, which I had for 7 years! Why 3 stars ...
While it's nice that this machine has the option to make larger cups of coffee, I would send it back if my old one would magically work again. The reason: I like HOT coffee/espresso. It's true the coffee is warm enough (if you want to drink it all immediately), but it's not hot! In other words, if you want to make your coffee, pour it in a to-go mug, load your things in the car and take the trash out, by the time you pull out of your driveway, you will need to drink your coffee all at once if you want it warm at all. I like to linger over my coffee whether I'm driving to work or reading on a Saturday morning. Unless you like to linger over lukewarm coffee, this isn't possible. I would absolutely LOVE it if there was a temperature adjustment on this machine. I've had it 2 weeks and am debating about whether or not I want to return it.

I haven’t been as impressed with the flavor of the coffee sized pods, but the espresso and double espressos are fantastic. The coffees taste more like a regular Keurig, although maybe a little more flavorful. If I’m making coffee for 2 or more, I’ll do pour over, because it’s just better and not particularly messy.

The motorized lid is amazing and the way that it automatically dispenses the capsule into the back bin is so convenient and elegant. I got mine in black and it's such a pretty sight. The milk frother is truly a thing on its own though. I get perfect, warmed, frothy milk in just a few minutes. I even use it to make hot chocolate and it feels like it was home-made on a stove.

You get samples ( small samples) of the various types of coffee they offer so that you have some idea of which ones to order.
It is the easiest machine to use, looks great on my counter, and the coffee is delicious. I also love the fact that there is that real European coffee machine foam on top of every cup.
You press the lever,it opens by itself and tosses the used pod in a container attached at the back ( they will send you prepaid mailers to return and recycle the pods). Put in a new pod, touch the lever, it closes, touch the solid green light on top...and Voila, great coffee !"

I’ve made good coffee using pour over (kalita and hario), French press, aero press, immersion, and auto drip (technivorm and baratza grinder). These days I want convenience as well as good coffee. I tried a Keurig for awhile. It was pretty finicky. Finding a keurig that didn’t make coffee that tasted like burnt plastic wasn’t easy. I’ve had an older nespresso machine, and liked their espresso. Decided to finally try their newer combo machines. I’m very impressed. Very easy to use, and the coffee and espresso are very good. Lots of choices with regard to drink sizes and roast strength.

Some things to consider.....when you buy this machine, you must use nespresso capsules. Capsules are easy to get on Amazon, or you can order them directly from Nespresso. The cost per cup, compared to other methods of preparation, is high. To me, it’s worth it. Only you can make that decision for yourself."

-- There is a variable delay after pressing the brew button without any visual indication that the button press got things started. So you're left wondering if you pressed the button hard enough, or maybe need to press it twice just in case.. until the coffee starts.

-- Sometimes the pods get stuck on the rails while sliding back into the pod container.

-- The pod container is solid black and can't see what's inside, until it's completely full and it is overflowing.

Now after about 6 months it started leaking somewhere internally and won't turn on anymore.

I see much better reviews on the older model Vertuo Evoluo (ENV135GY). That one has a transparent pod container on the side. I'm going to try that model as a replacement.

Nespresso needs to make better machines. Nespresso Vertuo produces a superior tasting coffee compared to Keurig, but unfortunately the new Keurig K-Supreme Plus blows this away in quality, features, and overall design."

I appreciate that it automatically detects whatever type of pod is inserted and adjusts the water accordingly. The used pods are recyclable, so we just bag them up and send them back to the manufacturer (free postage), so this product generates no trash beyond the packaging it ships in. It’s easy to clean and maintain; we’ve had no problems in 8 months of daily use.

The pods cost about 85 cents each, which is a little more than the grounds for a conventional espresso machine, but it takes no time to prepare or clean up. We’re all busy, and no one wants to spend three minutes washing coffee grounds out of all the crevices of their machine. This simplicity, speed, and cleanliness makes the Nespresso a great value."

Save your self the time and money. The expensive coffee machine gives you the feeling of making a better expresso coffee but you really aren't. Nespresso capsules are actually very fresh and sealed in aluminum for freshness so Dont mix it up with the k cups, which are in plastic. The freshness and the brew of this coffee maker is side by side with the $500+ coffee machines.

Except this is much easier and faster to use. They took a $500+ coffee machine, made it simple and faster to use with coffee ready to go in capsules with the perfect size of coffee printed on the barcode on the capsules themselves. And made the whole machine affordable to everyone."

It seems that the seals on some of these that fit the top of the coffee pod randomly go hard and crack letting the coffee escape as the pod is spun. You'll know if you're one of the unlucky few if you start getting coffee down the back of the machine and all over your counter. If you're really unlucky like me, it will be just out of warranty and they'll want $125 to fix it or they'll give you a discount on a new one after accusing you of being the problem because you didn't clean the machine ONCE A WEEK. Who does that?. In any case, neither is really an acceptable solution to what is definitely a design flaw. My old Tossimo worked for 11 years and I only switched to this machine because I couldn't find the pods for that one anywhere anymore. So, my recommendation is to run in the other direction. Buy a different model, buy a Keurig, buy a drip coffee maker... Or if you're feeling lucky, roll the dice. I wish you luck!

Update: I liked the coffee enough that we rolled the dice and bought a new Virtuoline Next machine. This machine is engineered MUCH BETTER. They basically gave-up on trying to stop the system from leaking and just engineered the new machine to manage the leaks. Now, any leaking flows into a little cup under the spent pod storage. So, even if the machine leaks, at least it won't get all over your counter like the VirtuoPlus machines do. Basically, in my mind, this is an admission that the VirtuoPlus machines have a major leak issue, and their refusal to acknowledge this or address it a few months past the warranty is poor business. Run away from this particular model. Buy a VirtuoNext. You'll lose the motorized lid, but you won't miss it, and you'll save yourself a ton of mess and money when the machine inevitably starts leaking."

-Completely customizable cup volume from 2 through 14 oz (a basic idea lost on Caffitaly or Starbucks)

(btw I would not pay more for the ALTO 14 oz pods - the more intense regular sizes seem to stretch to 12 oz + and still give you a great cup.)

-Water tank you can grip in one hand, lift off, and refill easily

-One touch powered mechanism to drop a pod in

-Used pod box you can lift out with one finger and empty

- ALL THE WATER ENDS UP IN YOUR CUP - none in the pod box, or anywhere else.

It’s been a month now since reaching out. Basically, even tho Keurig isn’t as fancy, I’d go with that at this rate.

The pods are a bit expensive (about $1 a cup) but I feel so much better about using this than K-cups that it seems worth it. Plus, $1 for a cup of delicious, foamy coffee seems reasonable!

It's automated so when you push it down you have to wait for it to slowly close on its own. And wait. And wait.

But the BIGGEST ISSUE... It now leaks coffee out the back - not water, COFFEE! I have to stuff the machine with paper towels to keep the coffee from running all over my counter and it only brews about half of the cup - the rest spills out of the back into paper towels. It's a mess and I'm going to contact the company but if they can't fix it, it's going into the trash.

Made OK coffee for a year. 2 stars because it did its job for awhile.

BUT they charge you $1.10 per pod which is absolute extortion. I work from home and drink 3 - 5 cups per day Monday - Friday. So the simple math is that this coffee cost me between $780 - $1,300 per year based on 3 - 5 cups per day, with 260 workdays a year.

If you pay $400 more up-front for a real espresso machine with frother, the taste obviously won't be compromised. In fact, you will have a much wider variety of coffee selections and strength options available to you. But more importantly, the coffee will only cost you about $375 per year max for higher end coffee choices - and more cups in a day. So the higher costing machines pay for themselves well within a year, and then the savings goes on for all future years.

You can opt to use the $900+ per year savings on something far more intelligent. That is of course unless you actually like paying well over double what you should for the barely noticeable convenience of a pre-packed pod (takes me 30 seconds).

The coffee flavors we’ve tried so far are amazing and the froth the machine creates on top adds a touch that makes the coffee seem smoother. The Aeroccino milk frother is something I thought of as a gimmick at first adds the fancy cafe/coffee shop topping that I didn’t know I was missing.

However, upon first use, which is a cleaning cycle of water only, a very large puddle under the machine appeared.

When making coffee this becomes even more apparent due to the brown color. I’ve contacted Nespresso through their store here in the hope of a remedy (really want to have a non-leaking machine). Otherwise I’ll have to reach out to Amazon for a refund.

I will update this review with information regarding Nespresso’s customer service and “fix” or Amazon’s response if I need a refund after all is said and done.

***UPDATE*** Contacted Nespresso by phone after no reply to email. Support person walked me through poking a paper clip in over flow hole and filler spout. Still leaked. They said since I had bought the machine through Amazon I must return through there. Easy enough through Amazon to send back.

Each type of pod has a barcode underneath that tells the machine how how to brew each kind of bean. The coffee brews quickly and tastes delicious and has a crema finish.

I didn’t have a mug big enough so I had to get a “latte sized” mug. The mug platform on the coffee maker is pretty small so you have to hold your mug on it the entire time your coffee is brewing.

Our machine started leaking coffee down the back of the machine, into the used capsule container, initially hiding but ultimately creating a mess following every use.

Trying to get it fixed was, unfortunately, very challenging and still ongoing. Instead of making it fast and straightforward to provide a replacement, Nespresso has a Byzantine customer service process that requires calling in (long hold times, with no monitoring of email), and eventually led to Nespresso sending a box for shipping (1 week), agreeing to evaluate and attempt to repair it (4-6 weeks), and then either sending a repaired machine or replacement (additional 1 week). We are mid-process, and this is taking in excess of TWO MONTHS, during which, we are without the coffee machine.

However, I was soon disappointed. The coffee temperature is MUCH lower than the original machines. I believe this is a known, due to the type of brew process (not using pressure but centrifuge instead). In fact, if you read the user manual troubleshooting guide, under the 'Coffee is not Hot Enough' section, it tells you to pre-heat water before putting it into the container. Im still suprised that I pay >$100 for a coffee machine, and still have to use my microwave to get HOT coffee. Also its impossible to buy Vertuo capsules in stores. And buying from Amazon, you can only buy a 30-pack quantity. My advice is to buy the Original model Nespresso machine, and get 'coffee' pods, instead of pure espresso pods."

I cleaned it like the website said I should before I brewed my first cup. I used the free sample capsules that it comes with. The first one I used was supposed to brew only 7.7 fl oz and I used a 14 oz cup. When it finished brewing the cup was overfilled and spilling everywhere. I didn't add anything to the cup before adding the espresso so I know that it brewed double the amount that it should have. It doesn't give me the option for choosing a brew size so I know I didn't pick the wrong capacity. I tried it again with a capsule that was meant to brew 2.7 fl oz and it filled a third of the same cup so I am left to believe it is my machine that is working incorrectly.

I can literally take a computer apart and put it back together with no instructions and no problems. This machine does NOT give instructions on how to use. It literally only gives instructions on how to clean it upon arrival. My coffee is always too strong no matter what I do to it. I don’t like super sweet coffee but I don’t want bitter coffee either. A nice balance would be great. Also I was charged for a milk frother that I never received.

Wow, Starbucks coffee is a thing of the past now for me! As many have mentioned, the pods are the “worst” part of this system only because they are so expensive. But damn they are good. My drink at Starbucks was always soy latte. I have now perfected my homemade soy latte. I use the purple espresso pod and run it through 2 times. Then I use original Silk soy milk in the frother. Add the milk to the double espresso and voila! Best soy latte I’ve ever had for just over $1 per day. Not cheap but better than $4.50 at Starbucks. I’m happy!"

This honestly tastes better than most $2 or $3 dollar coffees or americanos that you would buy at any other store. The keurig should not be in the same conversation as this machine, there is a massive difference in taste, keurig tastes almost like instant coffee most of the time."

I read the manual which referred me to a specific # for solid red light. No go, called the club #, talked to a very nice agent who really tried to help it still did not work, so I was required to send it to them, because Amazon would put it back in inventory without fixing it. Company has quick turn around, so they fixed it, sent it back & it works. Unfortunately, I find the coffee very distasteful. So I will continue to use my Aeropress & battery frother.

I opened the Amazon box it was in to discover the actual packaging looked like it had been man handled by a toddler with jelly covered hands. The box had a sticker that said it was new, but you could see it wasn't. The plastic handle that is on the top was missing, the cardboard tabs that are used to tuck in and close box were missing. It looked as if someone opened the box, used it, didn't like it, and threw it back in the box. So I figure let me see if the unit looks used. Some of the machine looked unused, but when I plugged it in and opened the top to see where the pod is kept there were coffee grains in the pod holder. My guess is someone bought and returned saying it was unopened.

This is not my first experience with nespresso machines, I have been a very loyal customer since 2015, with more than 200 sleeves per year! … I replaced over 5 machines since then! Yes 5 machines! This is not what to expect from a reputable company. Honestly, Their machines are not reliable at all, even if you do all their maintenance recommendations with descaling and clean cycles and everything… I love their coffee, it’s the best, but because of their crappy machines, I will stop buying their coffee. A lot of people on YouTube are complaining about their machines too, leakage, blockage, stopped working, you name it. Bottom line: unless they start doing factory recalls on their defective machines, or work on better machines, don’t buy their coffee/products."

I like in particular the ability to use refillable coffee capsules, where I can use high quality expresso like Intelligensia's Black Cat beans. The Vertuo coffee system of Nespresso was supposed to be an improvement on the classic system. Our experience with this machine has been anything but positive. My guess is that Nespresso is trying to suppress the customization of capsules, and require that all capsules be purchased directly from Nespresso. So, the idea is that Nespresso uses centrifugal forces (high speed spinning) to extract coffee... brewing parameters are adjusted for each capsule, using the barcode data to regulate the flow and volume of water, as well as temperature, infusion time and capsule rotation speed, which is a process Nespresso says helps to produce a rich crema. In fact, this machine consistently produces bitter, foul coffee (but the crema looks good). Cleaning doesn't help, nor does any other adjustment documented in the manual. You can't buy refillable capsules that allow you to use your own coffee, either ... this is probably the main reason that Nespresso switched to the Vertuo system. The older classical system has become hard to find, which was a big reason for taking a gamble on their new Vertuo system."

But within a few months again, we've had the same issues. And unfortunately we're outside our return window. So we have had to go back to our tried and true Keurig.

Unfortunately, Nespresso probably adds some foam agent to their coffees because the crema is simply excessive and it settles in a weired foamy residue after a a few minutes. Not very appetizing. Nespresso is not treating its customers seriously. I have addressed this issue with them and received a boiler response, lecturing me that I don't know what I am takling about and that the foam is great....maybe some people like it....I simply scoop the foam and throw it away. Always need another cup to store it....
Additonally, I ordered pods one week ago with ""second-day shipping."" One week later, still no coffee and a ""blame shipping company"" response.
I am waitng for another company to pick up the slack. Nespresso apears to be a ""caring company"" on the surface, but it is not really concered with its customers' feedback. I have to say I had issues with a previous machine and they have not addressed them either. It was leaking right after the warranty expired."

The Nespresso Vertuoplus Coffee and Espresso Maker in Silver sells at retail stores for $199.99 and includes the Aeroccino3 Milk Frother (which sells on Amazon for $80.00). So on Amazon the equivalent pair would cost $124.99+80.00=$204.00, not a better deal than retail. But the biggest difference is the size of the water container: While the water containers from both units mentioned are equal in height, the diameter of the water container on the unit purchased on Amazon measures 3.5 inches whereas the retail store version measures 4 1/8 inches in diameter (the wall thickness of both being the same. Finally while the Grey color looks nice on a computer screen the actual plastic grey container clearly announces that it is plastic and the color is what you would find in a garage more than a kitchen or home bar."

I even microwaved my coffee mugs so they were piping hot, and frothed the creamer, and it did absolutely nothing. As for me and my household, we only do hot coffee, unless we are drinking iced. I will also note, that when I put the middle pod in, which is an Altissio, barely anything happened, a few drops of coffee came out, and that was it. I’m thinking I may have received a used, or broken machine as well. When I received my package, it looked like the box was worn, weathered, and previously opened. The frother also does not do a very good job of frothing. I have another frother from Espressotoria, and it’s amazing. So, there’s my eperience with Nespresso Vertuo Plus.

Kidding aside, this produces flavors 300% better than the best keurig. Only draw backs are limited selection of pods, absolutely no tea, and you can't get just straight hot water from it. To tell the truth, I keep this machine and a keurig in my kitchen."

Exactly one month after the warranty expired, the machine started leaking copious amounts of brewed coffee from the bottom of the machine. I did a Google search that yielded hundreds of similar complaints. Taking the advice of one troubleshooter, I called the manufacturer. After being disconnected during the first call, I found an agent who tried to talk me through a fix over the phone, reading cheat notes from a company-issued binder, which meant that there was not much thinking outside-of-the-box going on. After 30 minutes of manipulating a toothpick, a toothbrush and warm sudsy water, we got nowhere. The final solution? Either send the $134.25 machine to get fixed for a fee of $125 or purchase a replacement machine at ""25% discount""--which, by the way, was the exact same price listed on Amazon. Neither were solutions that I found to be acceptable. I can only thank my stars that I have my old Keurig still in the garage."

Fortunately Amazon took the machine back, although I had to pay a 20% restocking fee.

Long story short, it leaked all over my counter. A couple of months later, started acting funny and found out it needed descaling. I bought descaling solution from Target, hoping this would resolve the issue, but it didn’t. After that, o decided it was taking up too much counter space, so I tossed in the garbage...yes the garbage.

I did contact Nespresso direct to see if they had any ideas, and thank goodness it was still under warranty so they had me send to them ( free of charge) and they are repairing it at no cost. Should have it back in the next few days.

If you MUST buy a Nespresso, do your homework on the best models, because this is not one of em. Or better yet, just learn to make espresso the real way and buy a machine that will outlive us all. No expensive proprietary pod system to buy into either."

I had been trying the MyCaps silicone top and filters. Don’t bother with them, as they are more trouble than they are worth, and may have contributed to the machine’s problem. We shall see.

I bought this in 2017 and just broke it out after a couple of years of not using it. Now I remember why I quit using it, the coffee is barely hot, I drink it black and even at that it needs to go in the microwave for 30 seconds. I am lowering review to 2 stars."

The Breville Nespresso machine produced a much thicker crema and a better tasting coffee than this DeLonghi machine did. With the green-colored coffee pods the crema on the Breville was nearly two inches thick, while the DeLonghi produced barely half that. I suspect that the Breville spins the pods faster and with more force, or at least it sounds that way. The Breville coffee had more body while the DeLonghi coffee was noticeably flatter."

After a time, by design, you will get an error indication that it's time to descale and shortly your machine will stop making coffee until you do. Chuck the Nespresso instructions and find a youtube video for your machine and follow along. There are only two controls, the cup button at the top and lever at the front. Sometimes you need to press them at the same time but other times separately. Sometimes you need to press the for a long (3s) time but other times just a tap. The machine state needs to be decoded from a multi-colored ring that blinks with different colors and different rates. If you are color-blind you may have a problem. My machine had been back to the company three times to be fixed before they gave me a new one with a shortened warranty. This required 4 or 5 phone calls of at least 30 minutes each. I've been using this machine for 18 months and still need to go to youtube to make it work sometimes. Also, don't stockpile a large number of pods because if you get frustrated and decide to trash the machine you could be stuck with hundreds of dollars of coffee pods you can't use."

I thought maybe it was because I never had an espresso maker but after a few weeks I realized it must have been either broken during delivery or just broken before I received it never really worked it took several times to get the coffee to come out even warm if it came out at all. Extremely disappointed I saved up to get me this machine and I never got it to work but a handful of times.

The box was torn and taped up and there were multiple return labels on it which made me question whether the Nespresso machine was used or not working right and returned. I’m very disappointed and wanted to return it for a new one. I tried contacting the seller thru Amazon but I never heard back from them.

A Keurig doesn't lock you into a single source for coffee. A Keurig won't lock up in an attempt to sell ""descaling"" packets. A Keurig doesn't cost as much as airfare home for the holidays

To be fair, this thing continues to work. It's not ""broken"" per se. But the next time it locks up _forcing_ me to descale it I'm likely to beat it to death with a baseball bat. Never again Nespresso. You lost a lifetime customer over a five dollar descaling packet. Congrats"

1529,1529,별 5개 중 4.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2019년 11월 29일,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 그레이,"First off, and most important, this makes amazingly good coffee. I am not an fancy coffee person, I don't do Starbucks or similar shops, I just like a good cup of coffee. And this definitely nails that.
The pods are pretty expensive, so this is not my everyday coffee but for a treat on weekends or special occasions only. If the pods were more readily available, and definitely if they were cheaper, I'd probably end up drinking it more often, but I've only been able to find them online so far, and there aren't any off brands yet.
My biggest issue with this machine is the lack of a low water light or something similar. When it runs out of water, it doesn't tell you. It will start making coffee and make only half of a pod because it ran out of the water. A few times this has happened I thought I put in an espresso pod which makes a much smaller cup. And of course once I opened up the machine and realized I put in a bigger pod, I can't use it again because it's poked so many holes in and the pod is pretty much wasted. Obviously I am working on remembering to check that every time before I turn it on, but that does not help my guests very much when they go to use it.
I also wish that the water reservoir was more firmly attached to the machine. It's great that you can position it to the back or the side, but it feels like if I am not super careful when I refill it, I could break it off from the actual machine. And, of course I want a bigger reservoir.
Overall, I love the coffee that this machine makes enough that I will continue using it, but I hope by the time I'm ready for a new one they have considered the design a bit more."

1633,1633,별 5개 중 5.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2018년 11월 28일,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 그레이,"I love coffee and have been drinking it daily for over 60 years. But I am the only coffee drinker in my house, and the hassle of making a decent single cup of coffee was always a problem until Keurig came out with its single brew coffee maker in 2006. The coffee was never great, but it was decent, and the coffee came out hot, which I liked.

Recently I acquired the Nespresso Veturo Plus ,and now I’ve finally found my ideal coffee maker. It is more convenient to use than the Keurig, and the coffee is produced is much better. It appears that this coffee maker is also sold with Breville and De’Longhi labels, but I suspect all three are identical.

This coffee maker is very easy to use. Unlike the Keurig, it doesn’t have a setting that keeps the water always hot, but it only takes a minute or so to heat up. The water reservoir in the Nespresso is larger, meaning you don’t have to refill it as often, and it is much easier to remove, refill and replace than the Keurig. Cleaning is easier, and the Veturo takes up less room on my kitchen counter.

While the Nespresso Veturo line of coffees aren’t as extensive as what is available for Keurig, I found the Nespresso coffees offered to be excellent, with a range of strengths that exceeds that available from my Keurig. In addition, I sometimes enjoy a double espresso, which the Nespresso makes pretty well.

I have read complaints that the coffee doesn’t come out hot enough in the Nespresso machine. But it does. What’s needed is a good, heated insulated cup to keep the coffee hot. I have found the BTaT- Insulated Coffee Mugs, Glass Tea Mugs, Set of 4 (12 oz, 350 ml), Double Wall Glass Coffee Cups, available from Amazon to be the ideal cup. To make a cup of coffee in the morning I first turn the coffee make on by pressing the button on the top. I then fill a coffee mug with water and heat it for two minutes in the microwave, meanwhile making my breakfast. When breakfast is almost ready, I pour out the hot water from my cup and brew a cup of coffee in the Nespresso. If I time it right, breakfast and coffee are ready at the same time, and my coffee is nice and hot for the time it takes to eat my breakfast. A great way to start a day."

Even the instruction manual instructs to unplug it from the wall if it does not operate correctly. (Seriously?!) I ended-up unplugging just about every other cup. It was an absolutely Terrible machine in almost every way. I almost didn’t get the Plus model because of the pitiful Next model… but I did anyway, and am glad I did. So far I haven't had any problem with this model at all. It has actually produced a good beverage everytime I try, which was impossible with the Next model. So if you have to choose between the two, in my opinion there is no choice at all. Go with the Plus model… definitely!"

1660,1660,별 5개 중 5.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2019년 3월 26일,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 그레이,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas 2019 and we could not be happier with the quality of the coffee and the machine is still brewing away with no problems. Seriously can't go on enough about the taste of this coffee, it's coffee house quality, if you love coffee, you will love this machine.

The Cons:
- The pods are over a dollar each and can't be purchased just anywhere. But still cheaper than Starbucks.
- The de-scaling business is mandatory and confusing and if done incorrectly will shut the machine down and the instruction book could be clearer. I had to call customer service to walk me through the process of button pushing at the right time in the correct order but it was simple once being tutored and they stayed on the phone with me the entire time.
- The pods have to be returned to Nespresso to be recycled but they provide a free shipping bag with a pre addressed, paid label that you can pick up at any Nespresso store or add to any online order.

The Pros:
- My experience with customer service for this product has been AWESOME! They are available anytime you need them and they are so helpful with questions or solutions to problems.
- We order the pods conveniently online and we usually get them between 1-3 days with free shipping over $35. They offer free samples to try with your coffee order.
- The coffee is GOOD, I mean ridiculously good, with many flavors, cup sizes, types of barista blends and espressos. Superior in taste and quality to any other pod coffee.
- It's smart and knows how to brew each type of coffee and it will let you know when your water reservoir needs refilling and when to de-scale
- Aside from learning how to perform the mandatory de-scaling maintenance, this machine is really very easy to use. Open lid, insert pod, close lid, wait for green light, push button, drink hot delicious coffee with beautiful crema with every cup."

I had it repaired under warranty and again in less than 10 uses, it leaked again. The problem now is that it isn't under warranty anymore and they refuse to stand behind their product other than wanting to charge me to repair it or give me 35% off a new purchase. Given the number of times this product has been used and that there is clearly a problem with this model (I have 3 friends with the same model and same problem), this is unacceptable.

I would steer away from this product and either look for a different model or else find another company which stands behind their product."

It still heats and agitates but as soon as it stops the foam collapses to ""thin soap bubbles"" in appearance and all foam disappears. Called Nespresso and explained problem, they said it was the milk. I explained that we always bought same milk from same store and it had worked fine. However, to make certain, before calling Nespresso, I tried whole milk, 1% low fat, and then Half & Half, ALL instantly collapsed just as the original skim. Agent insisted it was the milk even though I explained that problem started with milk from open container which was sued next day (a gallon lasts us 3 - 4 days). They will do nothing, they insist it is the milk. Utterly unprofessional company marketing a complex machine which they are incapable of technically supporting.

My original review was not very favorable due to the fact you can not reuse the pods. I need to backtrack and say that you can reuse the pods if you do not eject them. However, you will not be very pleased with the results. However they come up with their grind calculations, the pods are spent after being used. Even if you adjust the water lever, which I did, the resulting ""second"" cup is horrifying. While I still disagree with them programming in a code where you can not reuse the pods after ejection, ultimately it doesn't matter. Still, one star off for the first machine being broke and the inconvenience of availability of the pods. Online only, and most are only available thru Nespresso. I have heard that you can buy pods from a Nespresso Boutique, if you can find one. (for the Vertuoline pods)

The first one I bought was broken out of the box. The lid was locked closed and it constantly flashed an amber light. After an hour of wasted time googling, I made another trip to Bed Bath & Beyond to swap it out, where even they determined it was faulty. I ended up taking their display model off the shelf as that was the only one they had left.
I actually LOVE the coffee/alto/lunga/espresso that this machine brews. The froth is WAY better than my friends original model. Here is the issue I have....they have designed the pods to only be used once. This is akin to the home printing manufacturers programming codes into their ink cartridge's so you can't refill and reuse them. This is nothing more than Nespresso's way to get you to buy more pods more often. This machine is electronic in the sense that it uses bar codes on their pods to determine the pod size and relative parameters to brew a perfect cup. I applaud them for this, but to TELL ME that I can't use a pod twice is BULL***!! There are those of you who believe this is perfectly acceptable behavior. Well not me. These pods are 20-30 percent more expensive than the original pods, which of those you can use as many times as you wish, and the Vertuo pods have very limited place of purchases. So now I'm in a quandary whether to keep or return this, yet again, for the original model. I simply do not like it when companies pull this crap. You buy their very expensive machines that use only their expensive exclusive pods, and then I can't get the most out of them. If I want a watered down ""second"" cup of coffee, that should be my decision, NOT yours!! And don't feed me this garbage about it possibly damaging the machine!"

We had bought the original version but it had mechanical issues so it was returned. At first I was reluctant to buy a machine that I could only purchase their pods. I got over that (as long as the coffee is good).

Here are my results after several months of use:
The high spinning of the Vertuo creates a dry coffee foam (they call it crema).
It looks cool but tastes terrible. I have to scoop the foam off before drinking my coffee.
This machine will not dispense hot water only. If you want to add more water to dilute a strong coffee or make a hot chocolate, you are out of luck.
I purchased the variety pack of pods and have yet to find one I really like. They are all quite strong (and I like strong coffee). These are so strong I have to add half/half to dilute."

1722,1722,별 5개 중 5.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2018년 12월 29일,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 레드,"The DeLonghi Nespresso VertuoPlus coffee and espresso maker is extremely simple and obvious to operate, brews a good cup of coffee, and a great espresso.

Most people will look at Nespresso machines and will want to compare it to the Keurig coffee pod machines. In a nutshell, Keurig has far more varieties of coffee, the machines cost much less, and the pods are cheaper (per pod $0.45-$0.65 Keurig vs. $1.10 Nespresso). So why would one buy a Nespresso? Well… it comes down to the taste and quality of the coffee and the ability to brew great espresso. The Nespresso coffees that I have tried are rich, with a deeper flavor, and have a delicious crema layer on top. For me, the Nespresso coffee is better than say the Keurig coffees that I have tasted to date..

I like coffee. I’ve owned a classic Nespresso espresso machine also made by  DeLonghi  for almost 6 years. I have a  Bonavita  coffee brewer, and used and discarded an embarrassing number of other devices over the years. When I want to drink a lot of coffee, I brew a pot from local roasters. When I want a quick coffee, I used to use 2 classic Nespresso pods to create an Americano (full cup of coffee from espresso and extra water). NOW, I use the VertuoPlus pods for a cup of coffee.

The coffees and espresso pods.
The VertuoLine pods have a limited selection of coffees and espressos. The DeLonghi machine ships with a variety pack of pods to try. The espressos that I tried were hot, had a nice crema and had a deep and rich flavor. I liked most of the coffees that I tried. They tended to be on the dark, rich side and had a deeper flavor than I have gotten from a Keurig machine. I found that I really did not like any of the flavored coffees that I sampled.

The cost for the espresso pods VertuoLine is $0.85 versus Nespresso classic pods $0.70-$0.80. The VertuoLine coffees are $1.10 per pod. In the past to create a cup of Americano coffee I was using 2 classic Nespresso pods at a time… so the VertuoLine is actually cheaper for a cup of coffee for me.

The pods are only available through Nespresso online or one of the rare local boutique stores. I ordered VertuoLine pods online and was very pleased to see them arrive the next day once and typically 2 to 3 days. The only caveat with the Nespresso VertuoLine pods that I see is that there are not as many varieties of the espresso for the VertuoLine (4 choices) as there are for the Nespresso classic pods (21 choices, ignoring Lungo). There are 10 choices for the coffees. I hope to see the variety grow over time.

Heat of the brew.
Some reviews of other Nespresso VertuoLine machines (not this machine) criticized the lack of heat for the coffee and espressos. I measured the coffee with a good instant thermometer and got temperatures of 161F. This is a hot cup of coffee which made me very happy.

The DeLonghi VertuoPlus Machine.
This machine is an example of simple-to-use functionality with a sleek, elegant design. There is a large water reservoir for the coffee and espressos, and a large discarded pod container (useful because the VertuoLine pods are a bit large). To use the machine, plug it in, hit the button on top (the only button on the machine) to turn it on and then push a wide lever on the front “up” to open the machine (via electric motor). Put the pod in, push the lever down to close the lid (via electric motor) and hit the button on top to brew. The machine takes about 25 seconds to heat up and start brewing. That is it.

A small critique.. I would like the tray that the coffee cup is placed on to be about 3/4"" larger. My mugs for coffee barely fit on the current tray. I am a little concerned that using an electric motor to open and close the lid may cause issues over the years if the motor wears out... especially for something that could be done without a motor (granted, it looks cool).

Overall… this is a great, easy to use, beautiful machine. I am loving the coffee."

This is a very nice machine. My husband and I love all types of coffee and welcomed this machine with open arms. We currently have a regular brewer and a Keurig. One would think that this machine is extremely expensive, but if you compare it to the Keurig, it is actually cheaper, and it is actually on sale via Amazon Prime.

Once again, in comparison to the Keurig, the pods run about the same as far as price is concerned. You can get them here on Amazon, or you can buy them from the Nesperesso website. They even have a members only program that allow you to get these pods, sometimes for a sale price and other goodies you wouldn't normally be able to obtain.

Unboxing: The machine is packaged securely, and it comes with the machine, the water reservoir, the drip catcher and the plug. There are about 4 notches that you can put the drip tray/cup holder on, starting from the bottom to the top. The water reservoir has a suction cup that moves the water from the container into the coffee mechanism. Actual contents: Capsule container, machine, water tank, lid, adjustable water tank arm, adjustable cup support and capsule container.

Simple instructions. You'll need to follow the instructions manual and rinse the machine first by running 27 fl oz of water through the machine.

Coffee preparation instructions: Fill water tank with water, turn the machine on, place cup under coffee outlet, place coffee pod/capsule (flat side up) in machine, carefully push down lid and hit start button.

Things to note: You don't have to force the lid up and down. Once you pull or push softly, it has a soft open and soft close on its own. So too much force may break the mechanism that opens and closes it.

When you open the lid to place ANOTHER capsule in, the machine will automatically eject the old one into the pod dispenser.

There are three sizes of cups recommended for this machine: Alto-14fl oz, Coffee-7.77fl oz and Expresso 1.35fl oz. If you want to top off your cup, you can simply press the start button once more and a little at a time will flow into the cup. Just make sure you have the proper sized cup.

Again, see the attached video for a more visual look at this machine.

I might also add that the machine comes with a capsule sampler that includes 12 capsules. The nicely packaged box gives a background and strength of each pod. I'm gathering that all the red pods are decaffeinated related. The flavors run from Intens (and no, that's not spelled incorrectly), Caramelizi, Elvazi, Giorni, Voltes, Half Caffeinat and Altissi. And before you start wondering if your eyes are playing tricks on you, there are 12 samples, but there are 16 descriptions.

The contents of the box also include instruction manual and a welcome card."

However, I was blown away by this machine. All the parts were carefully packed and obviously high quality. The box of sample capsules looks like a box of Godiva chocolates, complete with detailed descriptions of each type of coffee and espresso, and the ""bonus"" aeroccino milk frother is worth it's weight in gold (more on that later). I drink decaf coffee, and it's so hard to find a coffee that is rich and flavorful. Most of them taste ""flat."" I was truly impressed by both the decaf espresso and decaf coffee capsules. The espresso tasted every bit as wonderful as the best caffeinated espresso I've ever had (before I switched to decaf). My daughter and son drink caffeinated coffee and quickly went through the remaining capsules.My husband says he still prefers his pour over coffee, but he really likes the Nespresso espresso. My daughter, however, prefers the coffee capsules, especially the convenience of popping a one in the machine and drinking a cup of coffee within a minute. Of course the bad news is the expense of replacement capsules. At about $1 a cup, it's cheaper than stopping by a coffee shop but still about twice the price of making pour over coffee (our usual routine). I plan to buy replacement capsules in bulk (after payday...), but I thought I would try re-using the capsules with my own coffee. I ordered  My-Cap's Cap to Reuse Capsules for Nespresso VertuoLine Brewers  and was very pleased with the product. You simply cut the foils off the used capsules, clean them, add your own coffee, cover with a filter, then press in the plastic cap. It took 3 tries to get the right amount of coffee so the machine wouldn't reject it, but now I can get it right every time. It takes a little extra time than it does to just pop in a purchased capsule, but I set it up the night before to save time. Moving on to the aeroccino: you need this in your life! It makes perfect foam each and every time in about one minute with the simple press of a button. I use 2% milk in my lattes and espressos, and the milk is the perfect temperature with a thick, rich foam. Sometimes I will just make a steamer and add some vanilla or flavored syrup (you can make your own-- just google recipes for them). I also use it to make amazing hot chocolate. My daughter puts half and half in the aeroccino and pours it in her coffee so she isn't dumping cold half and half into hot coffee.BTW, the aeorccino that comes with this set is sold by itself for over $200, so it truly is a great bonus item. One last note: be sure that any accessories or pods you buy are specifically made for VertuoLine (not the original line) because the sizes are different."

We are moderate coffee drinkers (2 cups ea. in the morning) and never really gave our tired old cup a second thought until we tried a perfect cup of coffee. Honestly, this is by far the best coffee I have ever had.
The machine is 172.00 and is ready to work out of the box. It heats up fast (15-20 seconds) and comes with 8 different coffee's and 4 espresso's so you can get an idea of what you like.
Pods are 1.10 each and cheapest at this time directly from Nespresso, however they often have specials and new machine owners get discounted coffee and a few freebies with your first 3 orders.
Why would you spend over 150.00 for a coffee maker? Or, 1.10 for a cup of coffee? Well, as soon as you taste it you will find out. We ran out of pods for 2 days and I was almost in a panic because they only sell them from Amazon, Nespresso direct and some Targets (but not in our area) I quickly ordered enough to last us at least 3 months.
This is definitely a treat yourself item, and if you love coffee buy it! If you hit a coffee house a few times a week then you will actually save a little money.
*If you are wondering what the difference is between the Originaline vs the Vertuoline , please see more information below, it does a great job explaining what the differences are and why this machine is better, at this time, than the original product (for coffee and espresso only).
The only drawback I have initially is that, at this time, there are no generic pods, which are usually less expensive, and no refillable pods.
When you re-order your coffee from Nespresso they also will send you bags for your used coffee pods which you can then recycle by dropping off at a UPS store or having them pick up. This was very important to me and one of the reasons I never purchased a Keurig. Lastly, I have had Keurig coffee and other pod machines in the past, but the VertuoPlus is by far the better cup of coffee.
If you want to try it before purchasing it, many Williams and Sonoma stores have Nespresso tastings, which will give you an idea how really fantastic the coffee is.
A solid 5 stars and a great way to start out your day by treating yourself!
- Upgrades/differences with VertuoLine vs Originaline from Nespresso.
- Uses centrifusion technology, meaning instead of using a pump to push the coffee out, it actually spins the capsule over 7000 times in a minute making a much better cup of coffee.
- It recognizes each capsule individually and provides the best setting (based on a bar code) for that type of coffee.
- Much faster heat up time, now less than 20 seconds.
- No need to change settings based on coffee strength or espresso, machine does that for you.
- Machine holds up to 14 used capsules which then can be recycled.
- Lastly, automatically turns off after 9 minutes."

I have only had the machine for 1 week now so I will try to update my review in another 6 months to ensure the machine is still working as expected. Other reviews have mentioned the water tank leaking and the temperature not being hot enough for the machine. I have not experienced any leakage and in regards to the temperature it depends on the size of the capsule you are using. I find the coffee and Alto sizes to come out very hot. I have not utilized a lungo size yet but I do agree the espresso does not seem to come out hot and is only warm. I would say this is more so related to the type of cup I am using though. I do not have espresso size mugs yet so I am using a normal size ceramic coffee mug which is very cold to the touch. I think the size of the coffee mug I am using combined with the cold ceramic of the mug and the small ounces of espresso create the ""it doesn't come out hot"" comments. I would recommend getting espresso mugs and then just running them under hot water so the mug is not cold before you utilize with the machine. I plan to order some and try this myself so I will let you know how it works. The taste of the espressos and coffees are amazing and the sample pack that comes with the machine is a great way to get you started to figure out which capsules you like best. I have yet to use the milk frother so again, I will follow-up once I have had the machine a little longer. I hope someone finds this review helpful. =)

Update: It has been a year since I received my machine. I still have not bought espresso mugs to try to see if that helps the espresso come out more hot. However, the coffees still come out very hot and with good froth a year in. I would agree with the milk frother comments that it only warms the milk, it is not very hot so you would definitely want to drink any latte you make immediately.

I still do not have any problems with leakage like other comments have mentioned. I did break the cup holder when I was cleaning it as I dropped it on the floor and one of the slot holders broke off. I called Nespresso customer service and it was very easy to get a replacement. The replacement cost about $9 and it was delivered within $2.

I highly recommend if you are having a problem with any of your machines to call the customer service line. They were very helpful and I got someone right away.

I am very glad I got this machine as a present. My Starbucks spending has good down by at least 75%. $1 per capsule versus $6 per Starbucks Drink, the savings adds up fast."

There's no denying the convenience of popping in a pod and pressing a button for great coffee. While the Aeropress VertoPlus may look like just another pod based coffee/espresso maker, it's much more.

Unlike the proverbial ""K-Cup"", with Nespresso you're really buying a luxury coffee system. While you can buy 3rd party refillable pods for the Nespresso, if you're thinking of going that way, you're probably not going to get the most out of this system. From the moment you unpack this stunning machine, it's clear that everything is focused around providing a luxury experience. From unpacking to set up, DeLonghi has designed a machine that gives that wow, out of the box experience that you get from brands like Apple.

The machine is really a vehicle for the Nespresso Club, which you sign up for online and has an accompanying app. With the Nespresso Club you get white glove customer service. My test unit had a leaking water tank and the support rep had a new machine in my hands within 24 hours. I didn't have to push or negotiate, that's their standard operating procedure!

The machine itself works flawlessly, from a motorized pod lid to its one-touch operation. The accompanying milk frother is quick and efficient and produces thick foam (with the option for less thick foam). The coffee quality from the Nespresso pods is top notch, you get a sampler pack of 8 coffee pods and 4 espresso pods. Additional pods can be easily purchased via their Club for around $1-$1.80 a pod. This is more expensive than bring your own grounds, but it's still significantly less expensive than a trip to Starbucks.

The Nespresso VertuoPlus does aerate the coffee/espresso at the end of its cycle. This is a little controversial as it boosts the appearance of the crema on the top of the coffee. Some coffee die hards cry foul at this, but this really isn't the system for the real coffee geeks. By aerating the coffee the Nespresso VertoPlus creates an amazingly aromatic and flavorful experience.

Understanding the environmental impact of pods, Nespresso ships a recycling bag which you can fill and return to them in a pre-paid envelope. It's not only a nice touch, it's smart business.

Ultimately, Nespresso has focused laser sharp on providing a luxury coffee experience, while it may be the penultimate coffee experience, it does truly deliver something special. The machine backed by the incredible service behind it make this an option for people who don't want to 'mess' with any part of the coffee experience but who still want an amazing coffee experience."

We ended up buying another Breville to get us by until our stuff gets here. I wish I wouldn’t have wasted $200 giving this thing a shot. If you want real espresso and can swing it, skip this step and go straight for the real deal.

I will preface this by saying we’re spoiled and are used to drinking iced espresso from a $600 Breville machine. This is NOT comparable to that - like, at all (as much as I want it to be). Even drinks from coffee shops aren’t as good as what we’re used to making at home.

We’re military and are moving, meaning we won’t have any of our stuff for a couple months. We wanted something to get us by in the meantime, but we really didn’t want a drip coffee maker or K-Cups. We wanted espresso — strong enough to make our usual iced coffee (8 oz milk with a double shot - nothing super fancy). I did a ton of research and decided this Nespresso was going to be as close as we were going to get.

We’ve been using it for over 2 weeks (2 coffee drinkers), multiple times a day - plenty of opportunity for trial and error. Hot coffee is honestly pretty good. These drinks, I feel, are comparable to a coffee shop. Iced coffee tastes watery, no matter what I do. (Less milk, more coffee, different pods, extra pods, ice, no ice, etc.) It tastes like the coffee and water are just separate, like they really don’t blend together smoothly at all. I feel like I’m drinking coffee water. (Again, this is after multiple attempts and a good $100 in different pods, in addition to what came with the machine).

If you’re NOT used to a full-blown espresso machine or ONLY want hot coffee, this may be the machine for you. If you’re in the market for good iced coffee, you really can’t replicate a true espresso machine using pods (no matter how fancy)."
1743,1743,별 5개 중 5.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2019년 1월 19일,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 그레이,"I entered the Nespresso ecosystem kind of pessimistically. I'm a fan of freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee. The idea of trying coffee from a capsule system ran counter to how I thought coffee should be made. And, I've tried Keurig and have typically been disappointed. But there has been so much buzz surrounding Nespresso that I decided I would give it a try.

The verdict? I love it. I will continue to brew fresh coffee at home, but now I will supplement that with espresso and coffee from my my Nespresso machine. When I want just a single serving of coffee, it's hard to beat the combined convenience and quality of this machine. I will share my experiences so far.

* Setup was simple. I like the detachable water tank because I can take it over to the sink, fill it, and quickly connect it to the machine again (here ""connect"" just means set the tank down. It connects automatically without even a drop of water spilled anywhere). One minor setup complaint/caution: I was trying to open the top of the machine to see where the capsules go. I thought the machine was broke because it wouldn't open. But the problem was that the machine MUST be plugged in, in order to open the top...because it is motorized. I am worried that someone might end up breaking their machine in an effort to open the top without it being plugged in. There is a simple cleaning procedure you should go through before brewing that first cup, but the directions for that are simple.

* Brewing a cup of espresso, or a larger cup of coffee, is simple. Open the top, set a capsule in place, close the top, and press the start button. The machine automatically recognizes whether you are using a small capsule (for espresso) or a larger capsule (for a full cup of coffee), the water used is carefully adjusted for that capsule. It is easy to adjust the cup stand to accommodate the appropriately sized cup for whatever you are drinking. It is possible to adjust the amount of coffee that is brewed from a capsule, and to even change the default amounts. I have not made such adjustments (the defaults are good for my tastes), but the directions are simple for making adjustments.

* The coffee is good! The Nespresso produces an interesting foam at the top of each cup of coffee or espresso. I like that foam. It is not cream, but the texture is creamy as a result. It is not a substitute for adding cream, but I find myself adding cream less often to my coffee when I use the VertuoPlus.

* There are many varieties of coffee to choose from. Nespresso makes the whole process of coffee selection feel...elegant. The packaging of the capsules, the description of the coffee varieties...it all feels kind of classy. Note that there are far fewer places where you can buy Nespresso capsules than Keurig capsules. Keurig I can find anywhere. Nespresso...not so much. So, I end up ordering online (from Amazon, or direct from Nespresso), but there are a few local places where I can get them as well. I appreciate that Nespresso clearly indicates the dates that the capsules were made. If you buy your capsules from a popular source, you are likely to get freshly produced capsules. I have to complain a bit about the price of a cup of Nespresso coffee. It tends to hover around the dollar-per-cup range. Sure, that's less expensive than buying a cup from a local shop. But, it is far more expensive than buying beans and brewing on your own.

* I love that Nespresso offers an easy free way to recycle capsules. You can get an envelope from them that you fill with used capsules and send back to them for free. I appreciate that I don't have to just toss these into a landfill. So, while I complain about the cost of a capsule, if that cost is going toward recycling the capsules, then it's worth it.

* The included Aeroccino 3 milk frother is a nice little bonus. It does not steam milk. But it will heat and froth your milk. I used 1% milk with pretty decent results. There are two options with the frother: short-press the power button to heat and froth, or long-press the power button to just froth. It was a nice addition to my coffee. Nespresso says the frother works best with whole milk. I'm going to try that next.

Sorry for the overly long review. If you are an experienced Nespresso user, then perhaps you already knew all this. But if you are like me...convinced that you can only get good coffee from freshly roasted, freshly ground beans, Nespresso might make a believer out of you. I like this little machine and have already begun ordering more capsules."

I've owned a Pixie (great machine), a Vertuo (also a great machine), and now this piece of junk. Granted, the Vertuo machines are designed for obsolescence, since the valves in the centrifuge fail after about three years. But for three years, my Vertuo made perfect coffee with every pod I fed it.

On the other hand, this piece of trash only makes decent coffee when it wants to. It's also ugly, it takes up way too much counter space, and the swinging water reservoir is awkward and it tends to leak. If I had the choice I'd return this machine and get another Vertuo, but I'm past the 30-day return policy so I'll likely sell it and order another one next year.

If you want my advice, if you want to drink coffee and espresso you should skip this cheap piece of plastic garbage and get the original Vertuo machine with the metal top. Or if you just want to drink espresso, get a Pixie. The Pixie will last forever and you can always make an Americano by adding hot water to whatever it pours."

I realize the DeLonghi is a more traditional espresso maker where you do the process yourself, the need to monitor the machine so it doesn't overflow is annoying if you want to step away. Though it can add up over time, I decided to go with a pod machine after my DeLonghi experience.

The Nespresso fits my needs perfectly. It looks sleek, the set up and cleaning is super easy. It's inexpensive and honestly, the Nespresso pods have such a distinct variety and good flavors that I don't need to venture outside the brand. I love the simplicity of this machine and how good it tastes. 10/10 in my opinion honestly. I feel like I got something with real value because the cost is in the range of other inexpensive espresso machines but this one operates super clean and looks great."

I truely love this thing. It makes coffee (5oz and 7oz cups) double espresso, espresso (three different blends/intensities) and altos (14oz I suppose you could use for multiple cups and only waste one pod vs 2 but you'd have to stand there and switch before it over pours. It's obviously for a thermos but you can do either!)

It has so many flavors to choose from (coffee wise, including decaf) I just don't like that some pods are labeled with just the logo of N. I have no idea what to expect when I use them. But for the ones with labels it makes it a lot easier to pin point what I like and want to order more of. I love foam and frothy drinks but if you don't like a frothy coffee this isn't for you. You can always scoop out the foam from the coffee but some of it WILL linger.

Aside from coffee flavors and options it looks beautiful and sleek and hardly takes up space on my counter!

As for the milk frother that comes with it, I have never in my life had such foamy and frothy steamed almond milk! I am beyond impressed! I mean BLOWN AWAY! That one aspect was worth every over paid penny! It will also froth your milk cold for iced drinks

Aside from coffee options, design and the aeroccino-
It's so easy to use! Pop a pod in and wait! Love it!

It does come with a sampler but it's confusing as hell for what's what. Also, I found if you are a prime member it is worth getting yiur pods through prime. 50 pods for under $45 is a great price. They also have variety packs and if you're prime you get free shipping unlile the nespresso website offers. Lastly- they have a recycling system they walk you through how to set it up but everything is 100% recyclable which is why I chose this product. I heard Keurig is a pain to recycle. And apparently you can reuse the pods with your own espresso/coffee but you have to tamper with them a bit. Some say its as easy as resealing. Hopefully they make a reusable pod soon!"

Yes it’s true...

This 100% is the closest cup of coffee to being in a French cafe.

It’s a very simple machine for the user, although it is packing some advanced and interesting technology inside.

Each coffee pod has a barcode around the perimeter which holds the information that programs the coffee machine based on the style of coffee you’ve chosen to brew, you just inserted the pod, close the lid, and press brew button.

I’ve attached a handy chart created by a Reddit user, which shows coffee blends, brew styles, caffeine content, pod color & names.

From what I understand, the pod is spun at very high speeds (above 10k RPM). My GUESS is the centrifugal forces simulate high brewing pressure while also aerating the coffee and creating a perfect thick crema.

I do have a discrepancy with either amazon or the manufacturer.. it seems they have multiple versions of the same model. Varying locations of the De’Longhi and Nespresso logos, and varying chrome accents around the holding tray. Difference only seem aesthetic, but stock photos on listing don’t represent the exact machine customers are receiving.

I’ll update the review regarding this discrepancy (if I get to the bottom of it). My initial hunch is either old inventory is being sold OR a new redesigned unit is being sold.

I DO prefer the look of unit in the stock (advertised) photos which shows the De’Longhi logo on the top of the machine with the nespresso logo on the bottom and the black tray.

Regardless, this coffee is the bomb.

Some more subjective thoughts..

Premium coffee comes at a premium price (relatively speaking based on “pod style” coffee brewing systems) but if you can curb your coffee habits away from those even more expansive options like Starbucks or your local hip coffee bar, this system is FAR cheaper and MUCH MUCH more premium.

Time.. yes, it takes valuable time to brew the perfect cup of coffee. About double the amount of time your common Kurig takes, that’s over a solid minute sometimes.

Pod availability & purchasing convenience.. I get my Vertuoline pods either online or at Macy’s. That’s it. You can’t just run to wallworld or Costco or really any normal grocer to grab some pods if your low and in a snag. (At least with my experience in central Florida)

Overall I’m very happy with this buy, and as (almost) always I got an amazing price on Amazon!"

I have been inquisitive about these larger capsules for larger cups of American-style cups of coffee. To get a larger cup of coffee, we very often use two of the original capsules at one time, using a little more water than an espresso calls for. I know that one of the Vertuo capsules is cheaper than two of the Original. Finally gave this Vertuo a try and am a bit disappointed.

The machine works very well: Efficient, quick, fairly quiet, easy to clean and maintain. You push a button and that's it. The crema is very thick, (almost seems like fake crema....). What makes it ""Plus"" and ""Deluxe"" is the fact that you can make both larger cups of coffee and espresso with the push of a single button. Nespresso makes two sizes of Vertuo capsules and this machine reads the label to add the right amount of water.

It's the Vertuo capsule coffee that falls short of my expectations. Out of all the blends that are offered, (I think we tried 16--twelve 8 ounce capsules and four espresso capsules), and I personally only like maybe 3-4 of them. Am I spoiled by the Original Nespresso capsules? Probably so. So beware, if you are used to the Regular Nespresso coffee blends, you may be disappointed in the Vertuo blends, too. Plus, there are many more blends and flavors to choose from in the Regular line."

The coffee maker itself looks sleek and beautiful. It looks and performs like the espresso machine from the future. It is black with chrome accents and has a very expensive, luxury look. The capsule lid is motorized and works with one touch. It is very smooth, quiet, and flawless. After the coffee is made the empty capsule is delivered into a bin on the back for easy removal. The water tank swivels so that you can make it fit to your particular cabinet or shelf situation. The drip tray can be adjusted to fit different heights of coffee cups or accommodate a short espresso cup. We have large coffee mugs, and they were right up against the machine. Regular size cups would work perfect. The “Milk Frother” is 5-star. The set up comes with a starter kit of different coffees and they are very good. Of course we like the stronger ones. It is not a coffee maker that we can use on a daily basis but on the weekends, we really enjoy making a specialty coffee with the froth on top. The capsules, I think, are very expensive and have to be ordered online. That is another reason that we would not use this luxury coffee maker every day.

Please Note: Nespresso has two different capsules. Depending upon which machine you have is which capsule you will need. The “original” and the “VertuoLine”. This machine uses the “VertuoLine” capsules. It will NOT use the “original” line. The “original” capsules can be found in many places including some “big-box” stores. I have yet to find the “VertuoLine” capsules anywhere other than online. Many different companies offer “compatible” “original” capsules. . . . Not so with the “VertuoLine” capsules, or at least not yet. I think one of the reasons is that the “VertuoLine” capsules have a barcode around the edge. I’m sure that Nespresso wanted to try and stop all the other companies from making money off their machines, so they made a new capsule that can’t be duplicated (or at least not yet).

One more thing. . . De’Longhi makes a lot of different coffee machines. Many of them are the more “fancy” sort of machines where you can use your own beans. Some of them are a bit pricey. . . Some are more reasonable. But in the end, because you can use your own beans, and don’t have to pay over a buck per-cup (as you do with Nespresso) . . .it can be more affordable even with the higher cost of the machine. But this Nespresso machine certainly makes it easy."

Unfortunately it started leaking coffee down the back of the machine just after it went out of warranty. We've tried descaling it multiple times but no luck on fixing the problem. I then did some searching and found that someone had fixed the problem by removing the rubber/silicone ring in the top that clamps down on the coffee pod, putting some plumbing tape/teflon tape on it and reinstalling the ring. I attempted to remove the ring but found that ours had hardened up and was coming apart as I tried to remove it. The ring never broke in two but would still make a seal so I just stuffed it back up into its slot without ever being able to put any tape on it and thought for sure I would be buying a new machine. I then tried making a cup just to see what would happen and what do you know, no leak.

Fast forward a few weeks and the original machine has been leak free since then. I suspect the rubber or silicone ring in the top of the unit either compresses from use or hardens up due to pressure and heat and doesn't seal on the pods properly after a lot of usage. It's possible that just pulling that ring down a little a little will fix the problem but I'd like to find either an OE or universal ring that would fit."

But the Nespresso VertuoPlus has. And pretty easily.

While I drink coffee for the energy boost it gives me in the morning as a large reason for doing so, I genuinely enjoy the taste of a good cup of coffee. Keurig brewers, even when using your own fresh ground beans, never really got me close to that. Don't get me wrong; I still think there's a lot of room for a Keurig in a house...in most houses, probably. But after the first time I tasted a Nespresso brew, I knew the Keurig and I were breaking up.

The Nespresso VertuoPlus is, in short, a Keurig for people that like better coffee. You pay for it, but overall, I think it's incredibly worth it. The VertuoPlus works almost identically to a Keurig. You pick your pod. Open the machine. Pop it in. And press go. There are, however, some major differences.

For one, the VertuoPlus delivers the amount of water you need based on your pod. There are sensors that figure this out for you, but at our house we just call it coffee magic. The coffee magic determines how much should be poured (there currently three sizes Nespresso offers) and brews your coffee (or espresso) for you within 2-3 minutes, complete with a lovely creama. The Nespresso has a centrifuge system that helps achieve this and also makes the coffee taste pretty phenomenal. Once you're done, the system has a receptacle at the back that will hold your empties, that Nespresso will actually recycle for you for free.

The Nespresso has a few shortcomings, but they all have to do with acquiring their pods. First, they are more expensive than Keurig pods. Where you can get K-cups for .30-60 cents per cup, a Nespresso pod will run you about $1 a piece. If you're willing to pay for better tasting coffee, you're probably willing to spend a little more. The larger issue is availability. Both Amazon and Nespresso offer online services, but it is frustrating sometimes when I can't just run to the grocery to get them.

Despite the issue of availability, the VertuoPlus has become my go-to coffee machine when I don't have time to press my own. The machine is reasonably priced, works incredibly well, and brews a very nice cup of joe.

After exiting descaling mode, it continued to have problems brewing the correct size (or brewing at all). I searched online for days - because I do love this coffee. Eventually I found a way to do a factory reset of the machine. That actually fixed the problem... for about 2-3 months. In the last few weeks it started having problems again brewing the incorrect size. Now, the machine won't even turn on (seriously I tried EVERYTHING - including checking my fuse box, resetting the outlet, moving it to another one, etc.).

I don't think of myself as being mechanically inclined nor a fancy-coffee-maker so I was a little hesitant about ordering this from Vine and being able to set it up quickly and use it. Luckily, Nespresso made it very easy. I took it out of the box right away, read the instructions for about 5 minutes, and started setting it up. Within 20 minutes (after doing a rinse cycle, per the directions, I was already making a frothy cup of coffee, easily following the directions in the booklet with minimal frustration.

Instead of doing an all new review, a few take-aways, building off of others' comments:

*I found the water reservoir to be relatively convenient. By being off to the side, I was able to put it a little farther back on our counter, which is great for our very limited counter space.
*This does fill to the very top of our mugs on a normal pour. I do like cream in my coffee, especially the frothed milk with the handy frother. A simple fix was to press the button once when I wanted it to stop early. I was then easily able to accommodate the cream/frothed milk.
*The coffee pods are pretty expensive, which kind of nixes this as our everyday coffee maker. We will likely kick this one out on weekends and/or long holidays. We are teachers so we have some long holidays where it would be worth lugging it in and out of the garage to use it for a couple weeks or even a couple months during our summer break. We will continue to use our regular coffee maker for our every-day coffee. The pods come out to about 75 cents each- cheaper than a Starbucks, for sure, but too much for a regular cup. For those that like to visit a coffee shop every day, it may be worth getting the pods for every-day use.

The milk frother is very easy to use and takes little time to set up and clean. I do not like to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning, so this is a must for me.

The coffees are excellent and Nespresso does a good job of describing each in the included variety pack, especially along the intensity scale. My husband and I were able to find several coffees that we are happily ordering again for those weekend/holiday coffees.

This is an excellent wedding/new house gift, or just a self-indulgent splurge."

But if you love coffee (and I was born with a cappuccino ladle in my mouth), this is an incredible machine!
It's very easy to use--after the first cleaning operation which lasts a few minutes--select a pod, touch the tab and up the top goes exposing a receptacle for that pod. Slip it in, touch the tab downwards and it's ready to go. I really like how fast the water gets heated so that it is ready to make a cup very quickly, certainly under a minute. This is really, really good coffee and you can tell this as the aroma hits your nose as it's brewed. One thing to be careful of, my machine does not reliably eject the used pod so watch for that. Before slipping in a new pod, the old should hit the used pod receptacle at the back of the machine with a soft thunk. If you don't hear that, it won't close on the new pod, stopping with a red light error condition. What has worked is to press the tab up again and it'll properly eject the pod.
Most of the pods in the welcome pack I can do without although for testing purposes I tried them out. I'm not a fan of decaffeinated coffee but even those tasted good. The head/crema on the coffee in the cup is glowing and sumptuous. Add some milk to that from the included milk frother and you're in heaven. The frother, or the Aeroccino 3 to call it by its proper name, uses some kind of magnetic levitation to whisk milk into a foam that is solid and won't break apart. This is real coffee house stuff here.
There's just nothing I don't like about this machine and if the pods were readily available and reasonably priced, this would garner an easy 10 stars. As it is, I'm going to have to settle for the 5. If you're a coffee fiend, you're going to get this machine, period."

The machine was simple to set up. Just stick the water reservoir on, swivel the water reservoir to the desired position, and run several cups of water through the machine to clean out any debris. Cleaning the machine is a somewhat animated activity. All you need to do is fill the reservoir and the machine does the rest.
This machine can make either regular coffee or Expresso. There are two different size capsules to use. The larger capsules are for coffee and the smaller is for brewing Expresso. All drinks are brewed with around a fourth of an inch of foam or creme on top. I don't believe there is a way to eliminate the foam, if that is not your thing.
The coffees from the variety pack are displayed beautifully and seem to be all full bodied. If you are a fan of Keurig coffee, this may not be the cup of coffee for you. It definitely does not have that watered down taste!

The pods are a bit difficult to come by. Some specialty stores sell them, but Amazon of course is a good choice. The pods average around $1 a piece, which is still cheaper then a artisan coffee from your local coffee shop.
One feature I am absolutely in love with on this machine is, the top off function. The machine is programmed to make 8 oz cups of coffee, but if you prefer a bit larger cup of coffee, you can push the Brew button at the end of brewing and the machine will keep going. A second cool feature this machine offers is, that it disposes used pods on its own into a receptacle in the machine. This saves you from having to constantly take single trips to the trash to get rid of your old capsule.
Overall, this is a fantastic machine that quickly makes coffee shop quality coffee. If you are a high end coffee addict, this may be the machine for you. I can't wait what else they come up with in the future!"

The unit was very nicely packed, and the instruction manual made assembly easy. The only thing that confused me was opening the top, where the capsules are inserted. As it turns out, it opens and closes via an electric motor, so of course it won't work unless it's plugged in. Also, the little attachment that goes in the bottom of the frother is very small - much smaller than I expected - so I spent some time looking for some larger attachment in the box.

Once assembled, you need to run it through an auto-clean cycle, which the instruction manual will walk you through. After that's done it's time to make coffee. It comes with about a dozen capsules, each a different flavor. This selection doesn't cover the entire line of flavors available from Nespresso, but I think there are only about four that are left out. It's very easy to use, just put some water in the jug which attaches to the side, press up on the lever on the front to open the top (which will automatically eject any old capsules and drop them in the bin on the back), and drop your new coffee capsule into the holder. Close that, place a cup on the holder on the front, press the start button on top and wait just a couple of minutes for your coffee to be dispensed. At the same time, you can put a bit of milk into the frother and let that run - it should be done in plenty of time for your coffee.

We've sampled quite a few flavors from those provided, and quite simply love them. They are strong of course - that's why you add the cream from the frother. My only complaint is that this brand of capsules is not available in any of our local stores, so you'll have to order them from Amazon. I don't mind the price too much, it's certainly much less expensive than going to a coffee house, but of course much more expensive than making ordinary coffee.

Overall it's a beautiful machine, it works quickly and the espresso is delicious. Cleaning is very easy as well. It's a wonderful addition to our kitchen and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced machine for their home."

The Nespreso obviously won't give the flavor of a well-poured, freshly mixed brew but it's OK for large groups, for people who use milk and sugar anyway, or for those who prefer flavored coffees.
Taste aside, my main concern is the same as for other similar coffee makers, and that's how the heating apparatus can clog with mineral sediment (and bacteria) fairly regularly (coffee is a good medium for this). I'd clean it out with lemon juice or dilute vinegar (or your own favorite cleaner) followed by a couple of water rinses now and then, and I would suggest doing this before you brew your first cup (it's manufactured in the usual place, so product safety should be a consideration).
This is a capsule-type machine, so you are sort of locked in to buying more of the manufacturer's capsules. I haven't tried to rig the machine so you can re-use your capsules with a favorite blend. The company does provide a bag to mail in used containers if you think the plastic bag, and the fuel used to mail it with, are sound trade-offs. If you don't use the machine frequently, you may consider that coffee has a rather short unrefrigerated shelf-life unless you use preservatives. Also, keep in mind that your ecological footprint will be somewhat larger with a capsule machine, if that matters to you."

But there are some Saturday and Sunday mornings that I just don't want to get out of bed and go get coffee ... And I have to have my coffee. Sure, I could send my husband, but when I do that, I have to order off the menu and it costs more money. When the opportunity arose to get the VertuoPlus, I could hardly contain my glee - it makes espresso! That's what I drink from Starbucks! It came with the Aeroccino 3 milk frother! I only make iced coffee drinks, but still - maybe one day I'll want a cup of hot coffee. Imagine my surprise to learn that the Aeroccino 3 does hot AND cold frothing! The machine is very simple to use, starting with a hot water rinse prior to brewing your first delicious cup. There aren't a lot of buttons or settings or things to fuss over - you just pop the pod into the machine, push a button, pour your milk or cream into the Aeroccino 3, push a button, and about a minute later you have a beautiful cup of coffee and a beautiful, foamy hot or cold milk to add in. As for the flavors, I have tried three of the pods that came in my sampler box, which I made all iced and with almond milk. I didn't really care for any of the coffees ... When Monday came back around and it was time to head to Starbucks, I told myself that surely my espresso would taste better with the almond milk than the Nespresso coffee had been. I was wrong. Apparently almond milk renders all coffee teetering on the brink of undrinkable. Now I have a pint of Half & Half in my fridge at home and the almond milk has been repurposed to make my breakfast. I could go on forever about how amazing and wonderful this coffee maker is, but I have a lot of work to do so I'm going to leave you with this: I truly believe it is a purchase you will not regret."

So far I've only tried the few samples that came with it. About a third of them I didn't care for at all. And that's not all that I don't like about it. The bad part of having this machine is the capsules for it are very expensive and I haven't been able to find them at any store around here or anyplace other than on Amazon and they are suppose to be available on the special Nespresso Club website. Haven't got around to checking that out yet. The biggest fault of this machine is it uses only the special coffee pods or capsules that are made just for this machine. They start at $11 for 10 of the same kind and the price quickly goes up from there. I've seen some for $22.50 for 10 and up to $45.00 for only 10. I don't know about anyone else but $4.50 for a cup of coffee is way too much for me. For me to pay that much for coffee it better be in a 24oz mug and taste so gooood that it can almost give me an orgasm, and a all day high! Now if the pods for it were a competitive price with all the other Nespresso pods that don't work with this machine, like under $1 each and several at .50¢ each and available at Walmart, King Soopers, Safeway, and other stores I would give this machine a 5 * rating.
The machine itself works pretty good. Except mine leaked a big puddle of water on my counter the first time I used it. It's very simple to use. Just make sure you put water in the holding tank, press up on the lever on the front and the motor drive opens it. Drop a pod in it, press down on the little lever and it closes with the motor drive. Wait for the green light on top to stay on then lightly press the little button with the green light. Make sure your cup is under the spout on the front first though. It does its thing and fills your cup with coffee. It only takes a couple of minutes to brew any cup of coffee that you have the pods for with little to no fuss no mess. Cept maybe some water on the counter. It's too bad that the special coffee pods for it are so expensive and are only available by ordering them online then have to wait for the mail to get them to you.
I did find a kit on Amazon that you can use to reuse the pods with your own coffee. I ordered one of them so that I can use my own favorite brand of coffee and maybe try some beans and grind my own coffee to make my own pods.
UPDATE
I'm now more familiar with my machine and I'm tempted to change my rating to just one star. First, the problem with this thing leaking water all over the counter is worse than I thought it was. This thing leaks all the time that it still has water in the tank! Ignore it long enough and it will leak the whole container of water out onto the counter. The other problem is with the coffee pods. About 1 out of 10 the machine will reject. Put the pod in, set my mug under the spout, close the top and press the little button, light flashes green a couple of times, then goes red and shuts off. No idea why it didn't finish the cycle. Put another pod in it and it works fine. Any where from 6 pods to 12 pods later and it does it again. It rejects at least 1 to 2 pods out of every ten and that's just throwing money away.
Once I use up the pods I have left this thing is going back in it's box and going out to the shed where I store all the other things that I have that don't work like they are suppose to. Then I'm going to take the money that I would have wasted on pods for the reject and buy a new Mr Coffee machine for good old regular coffee."

But based upon the fact that I was a part owner of a coffee shop in Oregon, I have some experience with espressos, single origin and blended coffees. My issues are these:
1.) There is very little distinction in flavor between Nespresso's espresso pods. The same is true with their coffee pods.
2.) Every single pod consistently spews out foam. For some drinks, foam is appropriate. For an Americano? No. For a basic cup of coffee? Blech!"

The set up is simple but make sure to read the directions because the first step is to prep/clean the machine. Also, make sure you use a light touch for the off/open /close lever.
I've been using the Nespresso machine for a few weeks and I love it. It sure beats going to Starbucks!
The coffee tastes so smooth, creamy and overall delicious.
""Nespresso VertuoLine Coffees are characterized by rich, generous foam called crema - naturally formed during the brewing process, thanks to our new Centrifusion™ technology. The unique centrifuge action of the Nespresso VertuoLine ensures you get every drop of flavor from each Nespresso capsule. Just insert a capsule and close the lever, when activated, the capsule spins up to 7,000 rotations per minute, blending ground Coffee with hot water and producing the perfect crema to complement your favorite Coffee or Espresso.""
It only takes a few minutes and my morning coffee has me ready to go!
I love the water canister that holds enough water for several uses (64 oz.)
The Nespresso reads each capsule so it knows exactly what to do. I did buy a separate milk frother so I could experience the lattes and cappuccinos fully. According to the Nespresso website, adding milk creates a whole new taste sensation, as well as bringing soft, smooth and creamy textures to the coffee.
For an even more indulgent experience, start by pouring about 2 oz (50ml) of milk in your cup and brew your coffee over it. I can definitely taste the creaminess described, Nespresso coffees are a whole new level that you, (IMO), can't compare to K-Cup like coffees.
I also like how on the Nespresso website it gives you a breakdown of the different coffee and espresso; their intensity, flavor, and smoothness.
Nespresso 's website has a variety of coffees but the sample pack included gives you a great idea of the diversity of the coffees. When the machine finishes making a cup of coffee it discards the capsule in a collection bin which is convenient. Nespresso also offers to recycle the coffee capsules, you can send the empty capsules in the bag Nespresso supplies but you have to request it."

I own and use a Tassimo daily and have used other Nespresso (espresso-only) coffee makers as well as various Keurigs. Hands down this is the best ""pod-based"" coffee maker I've ever used.

There are a few reasons for this. First, this unit takes pods for both coffee and espresso. The pods have the same base (so they fit the machine), but different sized shells so that they have the right amount and grind of coffee for the drink they are making. The base of the pods has what is essentially bar code that tells the machine how to brew that coffee. Finally, this machine doesn't just force hot water/steam down through the pod (like my Tassimo or a Keurig). Instead, it swirls the hot water/steam around the pods. This creates an insane amount of crema while still giving you a strong coffee or shot of espresso.

The machine is a breeze to set up and use. The holding tray for your cup can be adjusted to the best height you need from a demitasse cup to a large coffee mug. Coffee is dispensed outwards from the machine, so even very large mugs can be used (not so for my Tassimo). The water reservoir is good sized and visible from the front, so it is easy to see when it must be refilled. To open and close the pod holder, just tap the front ""handle"". It is motorized and slides open and shuts at a touch.

Some folks mentioned only being able to get pods from Amazon. Target also sells the pods as do some Macys. And of course you can order direct from Nespresso. The only disappointment for me is that you really can only do coffee and espresso. My Tassimo has chocolate, milk, and tea pods as well and we've found that versatility to be handy at times.

Finally, Nespresso has a recycling program for their pods, so you can get a bag for your used pods and send them back, free of charge. I really like that as it eliminates one of the issues with these pod-based machines"

My one and only compliant would be: “how incredibly wasteful, and limiting these machines pod business model can be”

The pods can easily become a very expensive habit, especially if you have multiple people using them. They claimed to be recycle pods, but still an awful amount of plastic waste being produced by one person on a daily basis.

I ended up buying a third party reusable pod for my machine and so far it has been working great. I’m just a bit disappointed with the fact that Nespresso doesn’t have their own reusable pods yet, if they are truly confident about their products they should have offered the costumer with this option by now...anyways

In summary, this is a great espresso machine for all those coffee fanatics out there, but I highly recommend buying a third party reusable pod. You will save yourself a lot of money and you won’t have to deal with the hassle of ordering Nespresso pods every month."

Nice features, then opening the top, press lever and it opens automatically (other model does not; although it did seem to stick a couple of times, will watch that). The water reserve tank is also nice that it is moveable. I have this unit next to my Keurig, and it does not take up much room at all because I have the water tank in the back/hidden.

The frothing unit is a big bonus. Easy. And very cool. Actually, you can do hot or cold milk froth (I'm using soy milk and it froths nicely); nice, creamy, thick. I start the frothing thing first, then the coffee; they get done about same time. I have it sitting sort of in front/in between the two coffee makers.

Now -- for the actual coffee. Have tried a few now -- regular coffee and the expresso. GOOD! I've added froth topping (hot and cold) to regular coffee/really good. I made express this AM and mixed w/frothed milk for a nice ""expresso latte"". Great. Since the pod/capsules are a little pricy, trying to use regular Keurig days/and Nespresso nights (I like nice cup of coffee at night). Although that morning expresso was really good.

Decided to try a Nespresso and glad I did as there is a world of difference in taste. Nespresso makes coffee that you savor; can't say that about Cuisinart or Keurig coffee.
However Nespresso coffee is more expensive than Keurig-approximately $1/pod versus $.50/pod and not as widely available. Also you don't have a choice in amount with Nespresso-you can only make the amount specified by the particular pod versus Keurig where you can choose between small, medium, or large cup per pod.
It really comes down to how important the taste of your coffee is to you. Very important-get a Nespresso and order the pods from their website for the best selection and price. Not important-get a Keurig, Mr. Coffee, Cuisinart, etc."

I grind my own coffee beans every morning for a normal pot of coffee, and that is what I drink during the week. But I've had Nespresso at other people's houses, and I always thought it would be lovely to have for mornings when I'm off work, for a weekend, or for a special occasion. I always talked myself out of getting it, though, because of the price of the machine and the price of the pods.

I finally decided to get this, though, mostly because it comes packaged with the Aeroccino frother as well, and I'm so sorry I didn't just get it sooner. The quality of the Nespresso pods is outstanding. i've used 75% of the complimentary pods so far, and I haven't had one yet that I didn't like. It will be a challenge to decide which ones to replace when I order more. I have only used the milk frother once so far, but it produced an incredible, silky foam that made me feel like I'd spent $5.00 on my drink.

I honestly can't imagine using this every single day, because of the price of the pods, but it has worked out the way I expected: I use it almost every Saturday morning to treat myself to a wonderful cup of coffee, and I've made a handful of lattes and cappuccinos on days off from work.

If you're waffling on whether or not this is worth the price, I think it is, especially with the frother. And even though the Nespresso pods are both pricey and proprietary, the incredible cup of coffee or shot of espresso you get is well worth it. This is not just an expensive Keurig, it's a lovely addition to any home coffee bar."

Pricewise, you'll save money replacing Starbucks with these $1.10 pods. (That's saving at least half of what a coffee cost at the local cafe.) You'll get crema, coffee in under 2.5 minutes, and 24 flavors to choose from right from the convenience of your home. I'm a coffee purist--no milk, sugar, etc. These coffees are really good, but you have to try a lot from the sampler to find the perfect cup for you. The descriptions are helpful.

This entry-level machine is quiet and it doesn't take up that much room. The interface is basic and not overwhelming. Easy 3-stip coffee process is convenient. I can't believe how high quality the coffee is!

There is a lot of technology you don't see in the machine. I hope it never fouls up: lots of codes if it does! [knocking on wood] But this technology and quality bean selection is the reason why it tastes s good. I call it the Dre Beats of coffee makers because I think that THIS is the way coffee was meant to taste like. High quality and pure. I have to limit myself to 2 cups or I'd be drinking coffee all day! Mornings are a joy and I look forward to my first cup.

Side Note: I'm pretty sure Nespresso's machines are made by DeLonghi--this one is despite not having any branding on it (except Nespresso at the top). If you get it on Amazon, it will say DeLonghi. If you get the same machine at the Nespresso store, DeLonghi logo will be replaced by Nespresso.

So far, I can't offer any improvements. I do have one preference they should consider though: a flat plug so it doesn't stick out of the wall (my setup is different)."

From the moment I set this up and made my first cup of absolutely silky smooth coffee it was love at first sip. The coffee maker is easy to setup and it warms water in less than 30 seconds. Once you place one of the pods in the machine the motorized lid closes and you hit the button. The Nespresso injects water and swirls it around the coffee until it come out of the spout with a delicious foam. I can't say enough good things about this coffee. It's smooth, and just about every pod (from the sample set) I tried was delicious. Even the decaf is good.

The foamer is an odd duck but it does the job. You pour in milk, although my girlfriend prefers coconut milk, and push the button. There's a small whisk inside that spins as the milk warms up. It creates an excellent foam that nicely complements coffee or espresso.

The one downside is the price of the pods. If you're used to picking up 100 coffee pods from Costco for $40 prepare for a little sticker shock. Each pod costs roughly a dollar and a little change. But honestly, the coffee is so good it's the kind of thing you make once a day as a treat and then use your regular brewer for the rest of your coffee needs.

One last note. I really appreciate the small foot print this coffee maker leaves on a counter. I've had Kuerigs for years and they are pretty large. This is a slim and sexy machine that would look good in anyone's kitchen."

This Nespresso machine is amazing. I even love how chic the little pods are. It was so easy to set up and I had a perfectly hot cup of coffee within a minute of plugging it in. I like how you can move the water container around the machine to suit your space. Having said that, I do think the size is a little cumbersome, and that is probably because of the water tank. Even when moved to either side or the back, it is still kind of bulky for my kitchen (I don't have a ton of counter space). Note: After refilling the water tank, simply set it on the base where it rests. Do not twist it after setting it down. My husband set it down on the base and twisted it, and water leaked. Just FYI. It didn't happen again after the twisting incident. This coffee maker is the pinnacle of coffee makers. I tried all of the pods provided and re-ordered the hazelnut pods as I like those best.

As much as I love the Nespresso machine, I LOVE the Aeroccino. It is amazing. Makes perfect foamed milk at the perfect temperature in about a minute. And it's so quiet! I confess I've been more into green tea matcha lattes lately, and use this aeroccino every day. It is so cool. I also love how small and compact it is, and it's pretty easy to clean.

Edit: Our office has continued to have a problem of water leakage when loading and removing the water canister.

We live in a state that makes fresh roasted beans and feel that the baristas at most coffee houses burn the espresso or serve stale coffee… we never understood and still do not understand why people actively stand in long lines and pay $5.00 to $8.00 for crap coffee. We also do not have a whole lot of time in the morning to make a proper French press, etc. before work. For this reason, Nespresso works wonderfully.

PROS: The crema that this maker leaves is wonderful. (Tasty, rich and thick.), the coffee tastes fresh and crisp, Easy to use (a couple of slight pushes and bam! – you have coffee or an espresso in a minute), time-saver, easy to clean (each pod slides into a single compartment and you dispose all of them at once), size, speed, a versatile selection of pods, super quiet and doesn’t wake the kids in the morning, assembly (open up super cute well-packed box, gently clean things down, add water to compartment- you will have coffee in 5). Machine comes with a variety of pods to try. CONS: The pods are expensive (but only if you compare it to a Keurig), but still cheaper than if we ran to the corner coffeehouse. Average cost of pod ($1.10 per pod) versus Average cost of coffee or Doppio at coffee house ($2.00). You will not be able to find the pods just anywhere...

I now know that you have to make investments in order to know what you are getting. Good coffee will cost more than the average. Furthermore, the next step is processing what you get to make sure you get the most out of it. I'm no expert in anything coffee, other than liking a certain taste. I don't know how these machines work. I just know the Nespresso by De'Longhi works and works well. An easy process to get your coffee made. The only downside of course is the cost of the pods.

I use to go to Starbucks nearly daily to get a double shot espresso black over ice for $8!!!

Now that I have this machine I'm addicted to the Double Shot Espresso Scuro its $1 a pod.
It tastes like a chocolate vanilla and I can drink a double shot a day every day of the week for $7 as opposed to Starbucks were I'd spend about $56.

My favorite coffee flavor is Mexico.

And my favorite limited edition flavors are -
Pumpkin spice cake, Italia Black espresso, Australian white over ice.

The limited edition flavors are available online and in store... I don't have a store near me in 50 miles so.... I order on the nespresso site and they give me free samples of coffee I never had before too!

I own this machine for 3 years and no issues.
And I own the Delonghi Evoluo for 2 years and then I have a classic nespresso maker as well but I like the taste of the vertuo better.

It was like nothing I had ever had before in a coffee shop and thought it would be awesome to have my own machine, despite its exorbitant price. I finally own one, but I use it as my ""special treat"" coffee, not my everyday coffee. The machine is easy to set up and use. It produces a frothy coffee without milk or cream, which offers a unique spin on the hot beverage. If you want, though, you easily make and add milk froth to the coffee, too, giving it even more airiness and flavor. Where Nespresso gets you is that you have to buy their ""Nespresso capsules,"" which are like Keurig's K-cups, but not exactly. This coffee/espresso maker comes with a sample pack, but you can buy more capsules from Nespresso's website and get a deal if you buy in bulk. That's why this isn't my everyday coffee; I drink about 3 cups every morning and would go through the capsules like crazy.

For the design, I'd knock off half a star in my rating. The machine itself is plastic, which seems a little cheap for the price, and the water tank hooked on the back makes it look and feel like an afterthought. I would have liked a machine that looked a bit nicer sitting on my counter."

- Makes your drink quickly in under a minute
- Decent size reservoir we fill ours every few days
- Our favorite drinks are the caramel and the Giorno. These are much stronger than anything we can make with our Keurig.
- On a per drink basis, it really isn't too expensive. They are about a buck per drink if you buy the pods on Amazon
- Upcoming is pretty minimal - but we find that it tastes best with filtered water
- We use the frother on occasion and it works well

This ""deluxe"" edition is identical to the twenty dollar cheaper regular edition except for: 1) the water tank is larger and 2) the cup stand and a few other parts of the machine are chromed metal instead of plastic.

If you've never had Nespresso coffee, you are in for a treat. Most coffee makers use some variation of pouring hot water over coffee grounds. The Nespresso utilizes a new way of making coffee by putting the coffee in a miniature centrifuge to force hot water through the coffee under pressure. The result is a rich coffee with a flavorful crema that is the equal or better to any espresso you've ever tasted. It is super easy to use and quiet and actually is smaller than my Keurig. There is one significant drawback: the pods are only sold by Nespresso, are limited in availability, and cost two to three times more per serving than Keurig. However, if coffee is your passion, then I think you will agree the Nespresso is worth the extra cost."

I've already ordered an additional 180 pods for this machine. I think it makes better coffee than Verismo and of course it's better than a Keurig.

The machine reads a bar code on each capsule and can be ""taught"" to make the same size cup given a specific sized pod. This is a really great feature as a frustration I have with the Starbucks Verismo is that I have to press additional buttons to incrementally fill my cup (I know this sounds ridiculous but when you are trying to make a cup of coffee while running around getting ready for work its annoying to have to keep returning to the machine to add more coffee to your cup).

They say the coffee is better than with other systems, I don't know... many people think so. I usually add vanilla flavoring to my coffee anyway. The Vanizio on its own wasn't enough for me.
Coffee will cost more than other systems that accept third party coffees, unless you re-use the coffee packets with the bar codes, which you can get supplies for, but kind of a hassle if you want a quick fix.

My biggest complaints with this model:
1) The cup support/holder/platform is too small in my opinion. Some may not care, but I don't like the base of my cup sticking out over the edge of the support. Sure it's works out ok, but it still bothers me.
2) The coffee dispenser is too close to the lip of the cup. It hasn't been an issue yet, but I just don't like the design. You might expect a liquid dispenser of any drink system to allow more room for the liquid to come out closer to the center of the cup.

I can't speak to to how the design compares with the other coffee systems, this was just supposed to be the latest Nespresso design so I went with it. Could have been a little better despite the benefits mentioned elsewhere (hotter than older systems, etc.)."

I roughly went through 500 pods this year and average down they cost well over $1 per coffee, there are cheap ones like 85 cents, but the choices are limited and you have to buy 50 pods per time.

So this one year I spent $169 + $550 = $719. I bought a Breville 870 for my father last year, which was $500, and he probably only spent $100 on beans for the past year, not to mention he also has way more choices and can also make milk foam with it. If we keep using it, the difference down the road will be even larger. It makes no sense for me to keep paying more but getting less.

For some reason the machine could not make more coffee after the first pod and even that was defective compared to the samples I had at the store. Not seeing much information in the box on how to return I bought the defective machine back to the store in Macy's. I was told they do not take returns only the Nespresso Club but by then I was going into surgery the next day and could do little. A few weeks later I finally could call Nespresso Club. The rep was very nice said she will email me a return certificate and that I will also be getting a shipping label from UPS. This label never arrived. I called again and this time a rep from 718 area code answered, she could not hold back her contempt when we said we wanted to return the machine. When she instructed us to put the machine out from 8 am to 7 pm every day for the next three days we asked if there was any alternative as we are concerned about porch thieves. She shot back asking if we live in a very high crime neighborhood, and that is just one instant of her many smart lines. Then she told us (between numerous sighs) to write down every word on the instructions she was to give us because we tend to be"" very confused"" in other words having senior moments. For three days I stayed home watching over the machine, no pick up. We felt we had run out of options and I was ready to wait out the weekend and then bring it to UPS store on Monday which by then was about 3 weeks from the time we connected with Nespresso Club. Thankfully on Monday UPS came knocking on the door, had a label and picked up the machine FINALLY! This return took over our lives at a time when I was weak and limited in my movement and should have been spending my time and energy on recovery and rehab instead of fending with a passive/aggressive rep from 718 NYC and all these misinformed instructions.

The coffee's pretty good, though it's not normal tasting, it does the job.

But, the machine failed 2 months after the warranty was up. Just before the 200th cup (I counted our orders), the machine started putting less into the cup and started leaking out of the back of the machine. I cleaned it, to no avail.

We have 30 extra pods we're going to give away, then toss the machine. We have a Ninja now that does better single cups.

Machine was off, but then the house started smelling weird so I unplugged.
Checked and the unit was really hot and electrical burn smelling.

Called for support and Nespresso bounced me to DeLonghi. I told them what happened and they basically said it's out of warranty, pound sand. I told them it could have burned down my house wouldn't you want to know why? They didn't care. Not even a discount on a replacement machine.

So I cut into the machine to see what was the issue.. and the mains were frying the spade connector due to a fault somewhere. There was NO breaker or fuse. I have no idea how this machine got UL listed with the amps it pulls when heating, and the shitty design for the main power supply. Fault - to - Fire and bad DeLonghi customer service? No thanks. Never again with their sub-branded product.

Nespresso is RAD.. loved them for years and still have my Concept C-190 original espresso pod machine.. like 20 years old. Coffee is bomb. The Vertuo pods are yummy. Support has always been great.

No need to wait for preheat to press ""brew""... if you press the top button a second time it starts the brewing/pouring as soon as the heat-up period is finished. Decent coffee with some pods. Machine stops at the amount of coffee suitable for each pod, and it is easy to stop early, i.e., get less volume than the intended amount.
Not so good: The ""crema"" is more of a foam on the top of the coffee/espresso. Gets annoying because it doesn't eventually break down. Nespresso over-engineered its pods to create a long lasting thick foam. Many of the coffee offerings are quite weak; we can strengthen them but cutting back the quantities made. But the espresso simply isn't like a good high pressure / pulled espresso.
Bad: Nothing. It is a very nice machine if you like their coffees and can tolerate the ""crema"" foam."

Keeps getting better, went to ship the thing back to NJ, and found return shipping will cost $40 USPS ground. lol. Can't really say shipping a $150 item back for warranty repair is cost effective. Especially given the product is only 6 months old and the damage looks to be from the factory.

After contacting DeLonghi I am told they no longer service the machine (only six months old). I must contact NespressoClub for service. NespressoClub tells me I must join their ""club"" in order to receive warranty service.

Still fuming over this, and after reading many reviews for issues with the machine having other issues with leaks, shutdowns and other odd problems that the ""club"" wants you to buy specialized products for (descaling), not even sure I want to send it in for servicing. Might count my losses (I still have two boxes of coffee pods) and give the pods to someone else.

ps: Joining their club means allowing them to install a ""special app"" to my browser to allow them to track my coffee and other purchases. Seriously? Who in their right mind installs software that is designed to track their web habits and agrees to this open invasion of privacy? Besides Facebook users, that is.

In any case, I asked for and received a shipping address to return the unit for warranty repair. I am told it will take 14 days minimum for the service - and that shipping delays might be incurred. Basically, once I get the machine in the mail, it will be at least 3 to 4 weeks before I can get it back to use it again.

Well, so much for brand (DeLonghi failed me big time) and so much for buying something that seemed to be fair quality from a reputable source (Amazon and Nespresso both failed in this).

What was that old saying? Caveat Emptor.
First impression was the lid never opened and closed properly. Always takes two attempts to open. I got used to that quirk and continued using it almost daily (often two or more cups).

Now, after six months, the thing is leaking like a sieve. The o-ring in the top is breaking down and chipping away (poorly made rubber does this). So for every cup I make - a portion of coffee is left dribbling out the back of the machine in a large puddle.

I'm going to see what DeLonghi will do - the thing should have at least a year warranty. Hopefully they can just send a new o-ring/seal whatever it's called."

That means you are paying over $20 per lb. for your coffee. Yes, you are paying less than you would for a professionally made latte but when you are out and about and you want a coffee, you also pay for the experience and convenience. However, when you are at home, do you expect to pay ultra premium prices for something you have to make yourself? A pound of Starbucks Espresso roast to brew at home is roughly half the price of the Nespresso capsules. Even Starbucks who overcharges for their coffee knows that making it at home should be less expensive than having something made for you. Nespresso sells you on the fact that it's less than buying something that is professionally made so you don't notice that you are paying $20 a lb. for coffee and then you have to prepare your own milk and add your own flavoring (if desired) in order to get something that is roughly the same as the professionally made version. To top it off, you are locked into $20+ a lb coffee because they don't want any competition and they add DRM to the pods. If they believed in their product, they could just sell it at a fair price but one major reason for DRM is so they don't have to be good, they just have to get you to buy. Once you are in, you are locked in. They made it easy to use, the espresso and coffee are good but they make it virtually impossible to get the pods and they charge ultra premium prices for something that you can get for less than 1/4 the cost if you get a grind your own espresso machine. It might be a little different if you could pick up some coffee locally but all of the advertised ""convenience"" is thrown out the window because you have to order the pods and wait for them to arrive... unless you want to pay even more... smh."

Most coffee makers use some variation of pouring hot water over coffee grounds, from standard drip machines to the convenience of Keurig machines. The first generation Nespresso machine used the traditional Espresso technique of pressurized water forced through the coffee grounds. While this produces superior coffee, it also is loud because of the pressurized pump required, and is also prone to mechanical failure. The new generation Vertuo machines use a entirely new way of making coffee by putting the coffee pod in a miniature centrifuge and using that pressure to drive the hot water through the coffee instead of using hydraulic pressure. The result is fantastic-- a rich coffee with an amazing crema that is the equal or better to any you've ever tasted.

The pros: it gives a rich brewed crema to both espresso and regular coffee blends. It is super easy to use and quiet and actually is smaller than my Keurig. It gives coffee that is the equal or better to Starbucks, especially if you use a separate frother when you blend in milk or cream.
The cons: EXPENSE. The pods are only sold by Nespresso, are limited in availability, and cost over a buck a piece. That's why I would really recommend to try before you buy if you can--- if you truly love great coffee or if you want to cut back on your Starbucks habit but can't face just ordinary drip coffee, this Nespresso could be your new best friend."

That was early July 2018, five months later in December 2018, we noticed coffee puddling around the rotor well where the capsule is placed. By January 2019 the amount of leaked coffee had progressed to the point where I called Nespresso and after some discussions about ""run a cleaning cycle and then call us back"" I convinced them that was not the problem and they issued a repair (UPS shipping) to correct the problem. That went quick and easy in less than a week and the repair paperwork indicated them replacing the ""Top Rotor"". Note that on an average day we make two cups of coffee and on the weekend about four or six each day. I did use the cleaning cycle and descaled every four months. So now eight months after the repair we suddenly have lots of coffee puddling around the capsule well and so much that it's running out the back of the machine and onto the counter.

I suggest looking at the Breville design, which appears to be better all around from materials and quality perspective."

First off I ordered this machine and they sent me the completely wrong machine (the Evoluo), and I called to have it returned and sent a new one but it wouldn't have arrived before Christmas and since the Evoluo had better reviews I said I'll just keep it. Now after Christmas, I go to use the Evoluo and it LEAKS EVERYWHERE. I called to troubleshoot and it was a machine issue not a water tank issue so they gave me the option of sending it back for repairs. I've read reviews about people sending it back for repairs and it doesn't get fixed so I'm not doing that. So I ask for a return and refund, BUT because ""I opened it and used it"" (once, I may add, before finding out it was completely faulty), I have to pay for this giant heavy box to be returned to them – they won't even send a return label. I also asked if I could just return it now for the machine I ordered in the first place, but nope because I said I'd just keep it before finding out it didn't work I can't do either. So as a first time customer – I strongly don't recommend. I ordered because I've had their coffee before and I loved it, but clearly didn't know their customer service and machine quality are terrible. My gift to my dad for Christmas is ruined and it's going to be a while until I get my money back to get him something else. Thanks Nespresso."

It will randomly work for a few days or weeks and then the process has to be started all over again. We were told the red flashing light means the sensor isn’t reading the code. Nespresso had us ship it to them to be fixed and sent us an older version to use temporarily (we wanted to keep that one because it worked). They sent out “fixed” machine back which worked for 3 days and then that dreaded red light came back when you hit brew. They were good about replacing most our pods but it’s annoying not being confident that you’ll get morning cup of coffee. The warranty has expired so now we’re stuck with it and the thought of sitting on the phone with them for hours going through the same steps that we go through every week is just not the best use of time.

In less than 1 year the VertuPlus begins to leak where the coffee is extracted from the capsule, read the online forum and it appears to be a known manufacture issue. Nepresso sells on convenience and quality, but now I'm frustrated after buying this expensive vertuo plus delux machine AND ordering monthly capsules from the Nespresso website. Did they purposely design a machine to break down this easily? horrible experience, called customer service to get a shipping label for maintenance and repair. 2 stars given, 1 for the lousy machine, 1 star for customer service with the hope nespresso will repair or replace this broken machine.

had this vertuoplus deluxe for a few months and it continues to malfunction and waste coffee capsules by pulling a short shot instead of a full cup. ran the cleaning cycle several times and searched online for answers. If Nespresso makes a crap product this is a disservice, simply outrageous to spend lots of money on a machine and capsules without it working consistently."

I decided to splurge when my coffee pot went out. 1.) you HAVE TO USE THEIR CAPSULES. And they are much pricier than I expected. 2.) This machine is LOUD!!!! it sounds like a rocket shipping off to space every time I brew a cup of coffee. Not so great when I want to enjoy a cup of coffee before the rest of the house wakes up. 3.) sometimes it doesn’t work right. You put a capsule in and press the button and nothing happens. Have to reopen it and start again, but because when you open it the capsules slides back to the empty tray even though you weren’t able to use it. You have to fish the capsule out and wipe out the coffee that spilled out because it already punctured the capsule. This happens every other morning so it gets pretty annoying.

A sign that this might be a problem is that if you purchase the descaling solution from Nespresso, it does not come with instructions with it and they refer you to the website because you have to watch a video in order to see the instructions.

I will maybe try a different Nespresso machine manufacturer when I toss this one because I think maybe Nespresso should just stick to making the coffee and outsource their machine product to someone who knows how to make appliances."

Packaging:
The packaging is fantastic quality both in appearance and for product protection. Colors on the printing were great and definitely works well if giving this as a gift.

Machine Appearance:
The look of this is machine is fantastic. Most of the unit is a shiny 'piano black', along with some matte black and metallic plastic buttons. Any metal parts have a nice bright shine to it. The water reservoir is robust and clear to see water levels. The machine takes up a little more counterspace than my old coffee maker. Overall it has my approval on looks and build quality.

Machine Setup:
Setup of the unit is easy. Be sure to read thru the quickstart manual to ensure the machine 'self-cleans' prior to initial use. Adding water is as simple as removing the reservoir, filling it with water, and putting it back in the machine.
Controls are simple. Click the handle up and the machine opens. Put pod in, click the handle down, and it closes. Hit the button on the top of the machine and it warms up the water and then dispenses your coffee or espresso.
The machine does not take much time to get the water hot. I was actually surprised that after a minute or two it begins pouring the coffee and that the water 'warm up time' was not longer than it was.

There is adjustment for the amount of water per pod type also. The controls for water adjustment are a little difficult as you need to hold down buttons while actually making coffee. It is explained in detail how to accomplish this. The nice thing is that if you ever feel the need to adjust the amount of water dispensed thru a specific type of pod, it will always remember how much water you prefer. Sadly there is no way to tell if you are on the 'default' or a 'custom' amount. It is great that it only adjusts the water for the specific pod you have in the machine. For example if you want a little bit stronger vanilla type and adjust the water quantity, it does not change the water amount in any other pods, only vanilla that you adjusted. The machine remembers and stores the information for each pod type.
To be honest, I have only tried changing these settings a few times to see how it worked, and then I realized that the machine and pods were pretty much set up properly in the first place. Nice though that you can fine tune it to your liking if required and that it only affects one flavor pod. Difficult as there is no way to tell what setting you are on.

Cleaning:
For the exterior of the machine and for any other areas, a damp towel works well. Not much cleaning is required for any surfaces other than a weekly wipedown during routine kitchen cleaning.

I love that the unit has its own 'wastebin' for the used pods. There is a rail system that will automatically lift the pods up and slides them into the wastebin. Wastebin is large enough to store 15-20 used pods and simple to wash if it ever becomes dirty. The bin is magnetic for easy removing, dumping, and putting back.

One thing to pay attention to, is that the machine requires a special solution that you need to run thru the machine for cleaning. This is to avoid mineral buildup, so be sure to be prepared for this type of cleaning when the machine tells you for this maintenance.

Pods/Coffee/Espresso packs:
The machine does come with a sampler of very colorful coffee and espresso pods that are available. While it did not include every flavor offered, there were plenty of different pods to sample to see which I liked. Pods are well constructed in that the foil and aluminum body is sufficient to protect the grounds. I have 'dented' the pods on purpose, and they still function properly within the machine.

Milk frother:
It does work very well for both cold and hot frothing. It utilizes a magnetic 'clutch' for the stirring device which allows for very easy cleaning. The most important thing that I have found is that the amount of milk really matters. Put in too much milk, and you will find yourself having much more milk than froth. However, as with any 'tool' you will need to learn how to use it properly. I have had the best luck with whole milk and surprising enough works well with goats milk.
This has been kind of a hit or miss personally since I typically just add milk directly to my espresso/coffee.
Having people over for a proper cup, you can bet that the milk frother is used.

Not many negatives to say, but there are some things to pay attention to.
1) From time to time, the espresso pods get stuck. If I make a cup of espresso, and do not make coffee again for a day or two, I have found that there is not enough weight for the pod to drop out into the rails and into the wastebin. It gets caught on the spikes that the hot water comes thru when the machine opens. I am aware of this issue, so whenever I have the machine open, I look for the old cup to drop and slide down the rails. If this does not happen, then I just use my finger or a wooden toothpick to get the pod to drop onto the removal rails. Careful as the spikes are sharp.
This is not typically an issue for the actual coffee pods as they are larger/heavier. Another thing that you can do, is immediately after having espresso, open the machine and close it again so the pod will not 'dry' out and stick.

2) While this makes a fantastic cup of coffee, you will be stuck at the pricepoint of the pods. I will leave you to compare the current pricing for the costs of pods. Currently, the cost is around double of other 'pod' systems, and 3-4 times the amount of 'generic' types. At the same time, this cost is also on par to that of fast food or gas stations (with Nespresso tasting far superior), and much less than the specialty coffee shops. So if you pay more than a dollar a cup at the coffee shop, this can be a cheaper and more convenient solution.

3) Coffee Flavor Choices. You will be limited to what is offered. The flavors that are offered are fantastic with an ample selection of flavors ranging from mild to robust, vanilla to caramel. Espresso you have four options. Decaf, you have one option. So perhaps with time, we will have more choices.

4) While it makes a fine cup of coffee and espresso, keep the following in mind. Proprietary cups means that you will not be brewing coffee with your own beans. This in turn means that you cannot get rid of your existing coffee machine on the counter.

Quick Summary:
Ability to make coffee: 10/10 - Makes a cup of coffee easily and without fuss
Packaging (looks/protection): 10/10 - Colors are great and care has gone into packaging
Ease of use: 8/10 - Simple to make coffee, little difficult to adjust settings (not that you really need to do this)
Value: 7/10 - Nice high end machine that looks great, cheaper than coffee shops, more expensive than other brands.

Overall satisfaction: 9/10.
I really like this machine and the coffee/espresso it makes.
I would like to see more flavors come out, and the ability to utilize my own coffee beans.
Would make a fantastic gift for anybody who enjoys coffee and espresso."

1956,1956,별 5개 중 3.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2017년 12월 15일,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 블랙,"I am giving this 3 stars and am feeling kind of badly about it. It may be my own issues with it, but I do indeed have a few complaints.

The water tank, which swings around in order to save space, doesn't really save space. It only moves so far to the side and it doesn't sit flush beside the machine. It drives me crazy because it looks like it should be moved forward a little and straightened out. When moved as far as it goes to the side towa rd d the front it still sits back further than the machine, so the tank and the machine could never sit flush against the wall/back splash for example. Perhaps my own pet peeve, but it does indeed irritate me that I can't straighten it out and it always looks crooked. You can of course swing it back behind the machine and then it sets nicely back in the corner of the counter, but that's not where I wanted to put it (my kitchenaid stand mixer sets in the corner).

The tray to sit your mug on. Oh boy. Maybe I need further advice on this or a different mug, or..? The tray is small. It also has a small lip going around the edge which essentially makes the space on the tray even smaller. I sat an average size mug on the tray and it *just* fits. Theres no room leftover inside between the lip and mug and you have to very deliberately set the mug on the tray to get it inside that lip, otherwise it will sit on top of it and be crooked/wobbly. Technically this isn't an issue, I guess, since the coffee/espresso will still go into the mug. You can move the tray up and down to accommodate for a taller or shorter mug, but there's no adjusting forward or backward. Also, the mug sits right against the machine, so you're really limited on the size of the mug you can use because of the position of the nozzle that puts out the coffee.. it will end up not going in the mug if you have an odd mug shape. For example, I have some where the center of the mug is fatter/wider than the rim of the mug and I can't use those with this machine because the coffee will shoot down half on the rim of the mug and half outside it closer to the machine. (Hope I am explaining this properly and not making it confusing). The size and positioning of the tray and the position of the nozzle should have been a little more thought out better. There needs to be a bigger tray, to accommodate more mug/cup sizes and shapes. The nozzle should then be placed above the center of the tray, that way you have room to set the mug where it needs to be and have the nozzle still at a position to fill with no problem. The other machine I've been using is set up that way and I can use any size or shape of mug, cup, thermos, etc. It works out very well and is a huge advantage over this VertuoPlus.

So, with that average mug size, (and really I think it is slightly smaller than average because it is sort of a decorative mug and the only one I had that fit properly in the tray), the coffee pods fill the mug to the very top. So, if you want to add creamer, milk, use the frother, etc, you cant because there's no room left in your mug. Now, if you dont usually add anything then I guess this is no problem, but in my house we all use creamers or milk and also use a frother (theres a frother arm on my other machine).

The frother. Hmm. It does a really good job, BUT... its a whole separate appliance which also needs to be plugged in. It has a heavy duty, 3 prong plug. I do not have outlets to spare as it is. I wasnt prepared for this to be plugged in separately and again that it my own personal issue. I didn't think it through thoroughly when looking at the product description before ordering, I guess. So yea, my issue. I do like the convenience of my other machine having the frother arm built in and it works just as good as this separate machine.

There is no ""drip stop"" type feature after you brew. Sometimes it can drip for a while and it irritates me because I want to let the mug sit there so there's no dipping into the tray which results in not needing to clean the tray daily... BUT I don't want to wait til it is done dripping... I want to drink my coffee! Maybe I am spoiled with my other machine and the drip stop?

The VertuoPlus does have some very neat features though and this is why I feel bad to go with the 3 stars. For one thing, I love how it spits the used pods into the pod container after you brew. I like the way the lid is motorized to open and close. Self cleaner feature is a plus, of course. And most of all, this is some really good coffee and espresso! Love the variety pack that it comes with so we could try different flavors and see what we like. Theyre not only yummy, but it's actually pretty. It looks like a box of Christmas balls when you open it, with all the pretty metallic colored pods. I had never tried this brand before, so yes I was impressed with the shiny, pretty colors :)

So, I will come back and add more as I use this longer, but for now these are my main thoughts on this machine. It does make a great beverage, but I feel like the machine itself could use a few improvements in aesthetics and tray size etc to be more accommodating. Also, I'm not loving the whole separate appliance frother, though it does a great job.

Also note that this set does not come with any of the mugs you see in the product pictures. It only comes with the variety pack of flavors. The mugs can be bought on the nespresso site. You can also download an app for recipes etc."

 I used this machine regularly, brewing no more than 1 cup of coffee a day. The Nespresso coffee would come out smooth and tasted amazing. I periodically cleaned the machine using factory settings and cleaning guidelines. However, 1 year to the date of purchase my machine started spewing coffee from the rear. A few ounces would pour from the rear and into the used pod basket. After some online investigation, I saw quite a few videos online with the same issue and within the same timeframe. There seems to be a consistency in machine malfunctions. It was good while it lasted. At this price point, I wish I got more than a year of usage."

1969,1969,별 5개 중 5.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2018년 11월 28일,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 블랙,"So this is nespresso's newer line that uses the vertuoline of pods, which sorta sucks because you have to pay full price on nespresso pods. The original pods, and machines are actually good if you just drink espresso type drinks as they have generic pods, as well as starbuck and peets pods. But back to this machine, this new machine uses the an electronic activated lever in front, so you just pull up and it opens, you just tap on it down, and it closes, powered to open/close. Thats pretty cool, and this machine isn't as loud as some video's show, i was expecting like like crazy whirring noises, but it's only slightly louder then the original machine. The water container is like double the size too of my essenza mini but this one does full coffee cup and if you buy the larger pods can do small thermos and larger travel mug sizes. So far i tried the odacio coffee, it was ok, smooth but flavor wasn't my favorite. I tried the diavolitto expresso and that was excellent. In both i tried frothing Oatly (oat milk) with a half pack of sugar, in the aero3 frother, and it seemed to work fine, heating the oat milk to an acceptable temperature. For some reason it didn't do well with the silk brand oat milk though, never got hot enough. I have purchased the nespresso melozio as well and will try that soon, which is another coffee mug type size pod. The machine does come with a sampler pack which i haven't tried yet. But this machine does seem to output more espresso, compared to the original, and mainly i think because of the pod size, so if you don't like small espresso shots maybe this machine will work better for you. Just remember you will pay full price for pods though. It might be more cost effective to do double shots on the original machine. So with that said, this machine has all the features of the old machine, but does everything larger, you can adjust water output just like the old machine, but this one has more automated features like the auto close and open for pod insertion. It also reads the pods barcode to know how much water instead of selecting the right size button, this machine only has one on button. It has a clean mode, and reset mode as well. The water tank can be moved from left, middle or right side which is interesting. The cup holder can be moved per cup size or taken off for tall mugs/thermoses. I currently marked flavor on 4 stars as i thought the coffee setting wasn't as good, it's a strong smooth coffee, but wish the flavors were better. Will comment more when i taste the other coffee pods. So for overall competition against keurig i give it a 5, as the quality surpasses keurig by a mile, but i'd minus a star just because of the pods costing so much. I expect the coffees to taste just as good for the price we're paying per cup which is about 1.10 30 pods for 33 on amazon. So compared to SB, you're still getting a deal, but wish the pods were a little cheaper. If you're planning on making lattes, recommend getting the combo with the aerocinno3 frother, as it's about 50 bucks bundled with the coffee maker, it's 99 separate. The coffee machine has a 40% discount if you create an account, so it's still cheaper to get the bundle."

But back down after the thrill of prime day, I grabbed it. A good quick espresso. But espresso is not a fast and easy beverage to make. Don’t judge espresso by what you get at Starbucks. Capsule espresso, next they’ll be having microwave TV dinners. Lol. But people demand instant over quality. All n all a nice little “espresso” machine. But will only use special mfr pods with bar code rims. The way it reads how much water it uses. ???

Update . After time to use, and time to ponder this machine and need ton purchase Barcode only coffee Nespresso type pods , You can’t use any other pod but one with a barcode, Causing more trash in landfills, negating the ability to use a reusable pod. Though there is a standard reusable barcode pod for a specific amount of coffee. Make a set for different types. People are looking more towards recyclability, reuseable products now. Get with the program. This technology failed and should have stopped on the development end of production. Boo to delonghi for not considering this. If you have there would already be a variety of reuseable pod sizes.
This is one of those worthless novelty products that are just a waste of any money’s spent, even when on sale."

Amazon gift card for my birthday, and decided to take the plunge. This makes superb coffee and expresso! I purchased a replacement policy but I have had zero problems with it. I enjoy a good cuppa of both coffee and expresso and this machine delivers. Try experimenting with the different paks offered: so far my 2 favorites are Giornio and the Vanizio for coffee and the Voltesso for expresso. A lot of folks complained about the cost of the pods. For great taste, I will pay the price! Still cheaper than Starbucks. The machine is fast and convenient to use."

But I think it rivals coffee from a legit espresso machine. My dad has a Saeco espresso machine that he spent close to $1,000 on and this little pod rivals it. I'm telling you this Nespresso machine does it right! I had my first cup at my boss' office when she kept telling me how great it was. When I saw the machine, I thought - yea, OK. I'm sure it's good but it looks like Keurig's baby cousin. I made a half calf and could not believe how good it was. Then I had a regular and I was convinced. It's so creamy and rich - like you'll find in Europe. All those George Clooney commercials are starting to make sense to me. I get it. I will never go back. The best part is they recycle their pods for free. So you can feel good about having 5 cups a day."

We have yet to try the frother yet but i'm sure it'll only add to the awesome experience we've had so far.

I use bottled water and I have run the machine 3x in a row with vinegar and I still get wonky brews. I am going to contact the company and see what can be done.
UPDATE I called espresso support and they very patiently walked me through how to reset machine. We did that and it works great and now I know how to problem-solve down the road. TIPS Use filtered water then you only need to descale every 6 months. The machine will tell you when it is time to descale. Do not push down on the button with the coffee cup light or the lever that opens the pod placement for very long. Tap and release. Keeping your finger there or double tapping either will reset the machine. ENJOY the best coffee ever!"

So far, this machine has done very well. It’s fast — even faster than the Keurig — not too noisy and the espresso tastes great. I use the smaller pods for a single shot of espresso. They aren’t the cheapest — this is the Vertuo line that has its own pods — but I only drink a shot in the morning so I don’t go through them that quickly. This model also comes with a milk frother if you want to use it. A nice convenience, and easier and cheaper than going to a coffee shop."

We purchased this in November of 2021 and have had the machine for just shy of three months. In the beginning, it worked fine but after about a month, it just stopped working and would blink Red when you tried to make a cup of coffee. At that point, I cleaned and descaled it and it worked again for about another week or so. Then, blinking red light again. Cleaned and descaled another time with no success. I called Nespresso customer care and we got it working, it made two cups of coffee and stopped again. I didn't have time to call Nespresso so it sat on the counter for two weeks and we tried again and had coffee for two weeks. Then, the same issue. Nespresso is now sending us a replacement machine. This also happened to my daughter's machine so beware this may be a common defect with the machine design. Also, make sure you clean it weekly and eject the cartridge after each use -- this was a tip from the customer care person at Nespresso."

We have been through 2 Nespresso machines in a year. We got another one on eBay which worked once then quit. All of the Nespresso ones leak into the pod collection area and create a mess. The De'Longhi one has worked SOOOO much better and faster. We are very pleased with it. The coffee is very good. Our use of Starbucks has plummeted!

It’s too new to tell if will have issues like some reviews mentioned. I got it for my hubby for Christmas and he is loving the coffee. It comes with a variety of coffee choices kinda like a box of See’s Candy. We mostly use the Melozzio. We look forward to coffee that much more every morning. We were using a “Cuisinart Grind & Brew”, it’s great but the hassle of grinding and brewing an 8 cup carafe every day and the clean-up is not very practical. I have to say this is going cost about $90 vs. $25 per month. We may go back and forth between machines. It’s hard to find the pods in the store, but Amazon has them in stock. I probably should of got the one with the other pods style as they sell those at Costco. I recommend it."

One complaint I have is the flimsy and slippery cup stand/shelf. As the espresso is brewing, your cup will slide outward due to the vibration of the machine. If the shelf had a rubberized surface it wouldn’t be an issue."

I decided to purchase another one & give the old one to my Daughter, since I will be moving to another place. We enjoy all sorts of coffee capsules that We both have purchase through Amazon as well directly online with Nespresso USA, these past years, they are the best!!! I know that the Vertuo Capsules can be very expensive using it on a daily basis, but it’s worth it!!
We also have 2 other types of coffee machines @ home, but honestly, I couldn’t personally go back using them. It’s the best investment I have done and if you take good care of it, it will last a lifetime. Sincerely, Magdalena"

One neat feature on this model is the lid has a motor to open and close where you put the pod in rather than manually opening it. You simply push up on the front lever to open it, down to close it and in seconds you will have an amazing cup of coffee waiting for you."

2070,2070,별 5개 중 5.0,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 2017년 5월 28일,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: LE 블랙 매트,"I’m not a coffee snob, but I do enjoy good coffee, and I think all the pods we’ve tried so far easily are way better than any Keurig pod I’ve ever had. Also the average price for the pods are right about what the keurig cups cost at my grocery store.

I love that the machine will automatically adjust the volume by the pod size. But I think what I like most is the temp comes out hot enough that I can start sipping it without burning my tongue. With the keurig I’m impatient and always put 5 ice cubes in to drop the temp enough to drink it, but I don’t have to do that anymore, so I’m very pleased. The frother also works really well and you can do hot or cold froth. For the price and convenience I think this is an awesome machine, and currently kicks the crap out of our keurig.

Again I’m not a barista so I’m sure you can make better coffee with a grinder and some fancy way to brew it. But if you’re already using the keurig as your coffee method, this is way better!"
