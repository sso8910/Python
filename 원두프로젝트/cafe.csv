0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Style: Machine + AeroColor: Gray,"""Is this a good coffee maker?"" Well, that's going to depend upon your expectations in coffee.

If you're looking for a ""pod coffee maker"" that makes normal drip coffee (think Keurig) then Nespresso is somewhat different, and may or may not meet your expectations.

I also have a Keurig. It's just fine for brewing basic, cheap coffee (or more expensive if you buy major-brand-name capsules). I like my Keurig--we've had it for over 5 years, and it works great. But, those who are environmentally conscious will soon realize that Keurig is not recyclable at all, and countless billions of pods a year are making their way into landfills.

Nespresso's pods are made of 100% recycled/recyclable aluminum. Nespresso is VERY focused on a goal of 100% recycle-ability, and provides recycling bags with fully pre-paid shipping. Fill the bag (holds about 75-100 capsules), seal it, and drop it off at your nearest UPS store (or Nespresso store/kiosk if you happen to have one in a mall nearby). Nespresso will dismantle the pods, collect all the used grounds and process it into compost for landscaping use, and then melt down the pods and recycle them. 100% recycled!

All those recycling costs are already built in to the pod cost, so while these pods are more expensive than Keurig, there is ZERO waste as long as the consumer does their job.

The best way I can describe Nespresso is it's a totally new coffee ""experience."" Espresso or ""foo foo coffee"" lovers will likely be very pleased with this machine line. Folks who aren't impressed with anything beyond a drip cup may find Nespresso a little ""snooty"" for them.

Nespresso's Vertuo product produces coffee that is much more similar to a cup of espresso. The pods are spun at variable RPM's (typically 3000 - 7000RPM) and use ""centrifusion"" - a made up word intended to commingle ""centrifugal force"" and ""infusion"". Basically, they spin the pod, a pump squirts in water, and the spinning forces produce the coffee which is extracted and drips into the cup. It's not particularly noisy for a kitchen appliance, but you can definitely hear the spinning. Regardless of pod, they all come out with a layer of crema (coffee foam). There are (at the moment) five ""sizes"" of pods, which produce 1.5oz (espresso) up through 14 oz (""Alto XL"").

As with any product line, there are pros and cons. There are some fantastic things about Vertuo and a few limitations.

Pros: Absolutely fantastic coffee. All cups have a crema layer on them, and there are a relatively plentiful number of flavors and intensities available, ranging from lighter and fruitier/acidic flavors all the way up to very dark bold and smoky options. There are seasonal special pods as well, such as holiday blends or single-origin ""master"" type coffees. Pods and contents are 100% recyclable. Easy to use out of the box--there's ONE button. You press it. It works. Milk frother (optional add-on, included in our purchase) is FANTASTIC. I thought it was going to be a gimmick, but I use it with every cup! It's easy to use, and creates that ""latte experience""--it makes better lattes' than a certain really large chain whose name ends with ""bucks""--yeah, you'll spend 'em there. Pod cost, compared to an espresso shop brewing an equivalent latte for you, is cheap. VERY tightly-integrated recycling: drop pods in bag. Bag full? Seal it and drop it off at your UPS store. Pre-paid return shipping means zero-extra cost. Done. Milk frother is VERY easy to clean--takes about 15 seconds, if that. I've only owned the machine for a month, but the build and overall experience lends itself to belief this is a very high-quality unit. Excellent app (iOS/Android)---you can view/order/manage pods, accessories, maintenance/cleaning products and subscriptions right from your phone/tablet. Love a particular flavor? Just add it to your cart. It even supports automatic/routine replenishment if you want that. Seasonal and other specials show up in the app when available, making the app a one-stop-shop. Company is VERY plugged in environmentally and has created a coffee experience that doesn't fill a landfill. If you actually play the game the way Nespresso intends, it's a holistic coffee experience and a great one at that.

Cons: No third-party pods, and pods are relatively expensive when compared to other ""pod"" brewing standards. You want this machine? You'll be buying Nespresso-branded pods from Nespresso, or authorized resellers, and at full-tilt retail which typically runs about $0.90 for an Espresso pod and up to $1.20 for their normal coffees (some origins are as high as $2.00 a pod). So each cup is roughly double the cost of a Keurig brew. There are about 20 different pod flavors and five sizes available, so most people will find SOMETHING they like, but if you don't love one of the 20, you're out of luck as there are no 3rd-party options without ""hacking together"" a used pod, some self-ground coffee, and some foil cap stickers you found on the Internet.

Overall, this is an EXCELLENT machine for those who want more than a pod of coffee. I've owned it for a month and I'm 100% hooked.","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2017"

11,별 5개 중 5.0,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 타이탄.,"Moved to keurig not for the convenience but for the environmental impact. As long as the cups are recycled, it uses less energy and less water than the drip and bunn machines. That said, i had sacrificed a good cup of coffee for this. Then i was gifted a KCafe which includes the frother, and options opened up, but the coffee remained so so.

So, then a friend tells me about this beauty!! OMG!! Not only does it brew a strong, delicious cup of real coffee, the pods are fully recyclable- through the company. The machine has a lovely form factor, and is a pleasure to use!! It’s quiet, and quick. I’m no fan of Starbucks burnt coffee, i prefer my coffee tasty, and this was surprisingly smooth, nutty, and delicious.

Also, when you go to the website, there is a nice selection of flavors to choose from. And yes, you can get hot water from it (press the button three times). Would I recommend? Heck yeah.

Happy camper, trying to convince myself that a cup of coffee at 11pm is cool, lol.

7/22- just wanted to add! My aerocinno3 suddenly stopped frothing my milk this week, after months of working beautifully. I called Nespresso, and not only to I learn about my machine, but i also learned that sometimes a bad carton milk will cause issues. Here i am cursing the machine, reading all the negative reviews and then as soon as I swap to a new jug of milk... It's working it's magic again! I just wanted to stop by and encourage anyone who's skeptical- take a moment to do some digging, this machine is awesome and the support at the company is superb! Still a happy camper!","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2022"

I find that the timing of making the coffee and milk frothing is almost exactly the same (open the unit, put new pod in, close unit and as it warms up to start, put milk in frother and the maker is then ready to go - start them both and they finish about the same time.

I needed something that would satisfy my ""boujee"" coffee lifestyle but still give my partner the ability to have his lam..... I mean normal coffee. The price of the pods, milk, and syrups are nothing in comparison to paying $5-7 for one latte 2-3 times a day.

Let me break it down (If you drink lattes every day):
- $3-5 for a gallon of lactose free milk that last me a week and a half or so
- $3-5 for vanilla syrup
- $1.5-3 for caramel or chocolate syrup (You don't need to get the high end stuff. I promise it almost all taste the same at the end of the day. You're just paying for the brand.)
- $0.87 for the pod depending on the one you get and if you get them in bulk (That can be recycled!)
- Reusable cups/straws
- No gas
- No waiting in lines

Seriously people. The hardest thing you'll have to do with all of this is find out what your favorite coffee roast is. And they even make that easy by providing you a sample box with like 12ish (can't remember off the top of my head) pods to try! My favorite is the small gold one.

44,별 5개 중 1.0,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 블랙,"UPDATE: I went for a Keurig K-Supreme Plus instead and it's one of the best things I've ever purchased! I am absolutely in love with it (and I don't usually get so enthusiastic about things that I've purchased)! Delicious coffee within seconds every morning – it actually makes me look forward to morning time, and so much variety!! It probably sounds like I'm affiliated with Keurig but I'm not, and I'm not being paid for this review. I just don't understand why Nespresso has such a following (I had tried this out because a friend told me that it's waaay better than Keurig, and that is definitely not true).

High-level faults before getting into the fraud/scam details:
1. It is very difficult to use. I work in tech, and love tech gadgets. With this thing, it's ridiculously difficult to figure out how to make a cup of coffee. I had to watch numerous YouTube videos. The amount of different combinations of button presses for each different function is just crazy. For example ""tap the coffee button three times within 2 seconds, hold two buttons for more than 3 seconds, then tap the coffee button to confirm. Then a green light will flash three times, followed by a solid orange light..."". I can pretty much guarantee you won't even be able to open the machine to put a pod in there without watching a YouTube video.
2. There is a VERY limited selection of coffees. While every coffee company out there makes pods for Keurig machines, Nespresso machines read a barcode on each pod, and will not do anything unless the pod is from Nespresso or Starbucks.
3. The coffee is just meh. I don't know what all the great reviews are about.

Now for the fraud part – seriously, there's a whole reddit thread about suing Nespresso for this:

I received my Nespresso Vertuo Plus today and was very disappointed to find out (after a lot of frustrating, time-wasting troubleshooting and researching) that the largest coffee it can make is 7.7oz, even though Nespresso says this machine can make up to 14oz coffees. However, Nespresso has discontinued the Alto/XL pods that are required to make 14oz coffees, but they still say everywhere that they can make up to 14oz. The whole reason I decided to give Nespresso a try is because they very loudly market the fact that this can make large cups of coffee (like a Keurig can), but it's literally not possible in this machine because when it reads a barcode on each pod, it uses the amount of water that's recommended for that pod. So, without the Alto/XL pods (which no longer exist, but you won't see that update in any of their documentation or YouTube videos), you cannot make a coffee that's larger than 7.7oz unless you use multiple pods, which would be stupid because the pods are already more expensive than their competitors. Nespresso even has a YouTube video that shows how to make a large cup of coffee in this machine by manually programming the amount of water to use. I tried this with one of the other pods (not Alto/XL), and even though I kept my finger on the button like they said, it still stopped at 7.7oz. They should clearly say that you can only make a maximum of 7.7oz because they no longer support the 14oz pods.

Final thoughts:
I'm originally from Europe but I've lived in the US for a few years. When I go into a coffee shop in the US, it's most common to see people ordering at least 12oz or 16oz coffees. Tiny little coffees are great in Europe, but Nespresso is being really stupid for making the majority of their machines not cater for the US market, which is one of the biggest markets in the world for coffee consumption.",미국에서 2022년 8월 19일에 검토됨

50,별 5개 중 5.0,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 블랙,"I'll preface this review by stating that I am an espresso drinker. I have an automatic espresso machine, which I love, and that is the bar I used for my comparison. I will say that the coffee produced by this machine is as good as the coffee from my expensive espresso machine.

I like the option of a quick coffee for some variety. I have had Keurigs for years, and am probably on my 5th rendition. The more I drank espresso, the more dissatisfied I became with the Keurig. I found myself having to use 2 k-cups to get one cup of coffee strong enough for my liking. I then saw the nespresso online, and began to research the machine. Although there are minor complaints about it, the majority of reviews were positive, so I decided to buy one.

I was torn between the older model and the vertuso model. The attraction of the older model is 3rd party coffee pods, which saves money but after watching many a youtube review, it appeared the vertuso produced a better coffee with more crema. I opted for the vertuso plus deluxe. The deluxe model has a larger water tank and chrome accents.

The machine was simple to set up. Just fill the water tank, plug it in, make sure it had a container under the spout, and it went through a priming/rinsing cycle. The machine comes with 12 sample pods, each different. I immediately made a coffee and it was amazing! The flavor was excellent. It was more impressive than my expensive espresso machine (likely due to my choice of beans). I've since had several drinks from the machine and am pleased with each. The machine knows the right amount of water, brew time, brew temp for each pod, due to the bar codes. I no longer need to use 2 k-cups to get a decent cup of coffee, so the price per cup ends up the same as the Keurig. I spent about $.50 per k-cup, and each nespresso capsule is about $1. The brew time is longer than the Keurig, but shorter than my espresso machine (however, my machine grinds the beans for each cup).

I love this machine. I immediately ordered more sleeves of pods from nespresso's website. My order was shipped the next day and arrived 2 days later! Also, the machine comes with a $10 coupon for pods and you get samples with each order.

This machine is fantastic. I have given it 5 stars. It is worth the price, if you like quality coffee. Not even Starbuck's makes a better espresso! Buy it!",미국에서 2022년 5월 21일에 검토됨

I finally decided to treat myself and now I’m obsessed with coffee. I look forward to waking up to get my espresso fix, and sometimes I even sneak another cup when I get home from work. It’s just completely changed the game for me and I love that they give you a sample pack. The quality of the coffee is just incredible and I’m thrilled with it.

Those are the pros, but there are SOME cons.

This particular machine worked flawlessly the first couple of uses but now the button isn’t quite responsive and it takes a moment or two for it to start brewing. By that, I mean I thought maybe the water was low, so I went to fill it and half way through filling it the machine started brewing. It was a mad dash to turn it off.

Next, there’s the matter of the pods. More so the attainability and availability of them. Williams Sonoma sells the original line but for some reason Nestle hasn’t released the the vertuo line to them yet, which, suffice it to say, is stupid.

Shipping an online order directly from nespresso takes a minimum of 3 business days for my location, which, maybe I’m spoiled by amazon, but not a fan of that.

Aaaaaand, seasonal creations sell out FAST, so you gotta pay attention to those emails, folks. Don’t sit on them.

Also, Nespresso boutiques are hard to come by. I live in a major metroplex and there’s only one about 90 minutes from me. If they’re going to be stingy about how many locations they have, why not allow Williams Sonoma to handle some of that retail?

93,별 5개 중 5.0,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 그레이,"I waited to write this review after seeing some comments in other reviews that the machine enters a descaling mode and breaks about three months in. Well, I've had my machine since Christmas (gift to myself) and I've had no such problem. I've been enjoying my coffee ritual so much now that I also bought a milk frother, but not the nespresso branded one as that seems too expensive. I love that I can make any coffee drink I desire. I love the different size pods, and how you can program each pod size to brew a certain volume of coffee. My favorite pods are the alto pods, which is new with this machine. And I love that I can feel good about having ""pod coffee"" again with their pod recycling program.
Now, about descaling. Last week, I descaled my machine for the first time and had no problems and the coffee is back to tasting like new. I thought the machine would warn me when it needed to be descaled, but 5 months in I never got the warning and figured I better be proactive. I've been using filtered water in the machine, so maybe that held off some of the buildup. I find coffee tastes better with filtered water anyway.
But, the machine was getting noisier, and the coffee was starting to sputter when coming out of the spout, so I thought it might be time to descale. So I used one of their descaling packs and followed the directions in my manual. The machine did its thing and now I'm back to like new operation with less noise again and more flavor for about a week. I wonder if perhaps the problems people had are because the machine's setting lets the buildup get too bad before prompting you to descale.
Last tip is Nespresso has a wide range of coffee profiles, so I suggest trying sample packs (and always ordering your free 2-pack when ordering pods on the Nespresso site) to find the right flavor profile for you. I love this machine and love having my morning coffee now!",미국에서 2022년 6월 14일에 검토됨

Love the ease of operation and the size. It is much smaller than a Keurig machine and looks great in the kitchen. Also I love that you can recycle the coffee pods by sending the used coffee pods to Nespresso in a postage paid envelope. I love this easy method. With Keurig, although you get recyclable pods, you have to separate the coffee, throw it in the regular trash and then dispose the remaining pack in the recycling bin. With this, you dump all the used pods in the postage paid envelope, pack it once its full and drop it at a nearby UPS.
The only downside if the cost of the pods. It comes to approximately a dollar to $1.5 per cup depending on the coffee and the deals/coupons you get. But this is gourmet coffee and something I drink only once a day (twice if I had a long day). For regular coffee, the instant coffee works for me.

Review of Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi with Aeroccino, Grey
PROS
The coffee tastes better than starbucks or anywhere that makes it. It creates a frothy foam on the top of the coffee and really makes it an excellent cup. This is about 10x better than kureg as far as taste. Initial setup was easy out of the box. First cups were perfect and the machine made them without issue.
CONS
After about 2 months we have run into a few problems. The machine does not consistently work and continues to throw out the error code of ""no water"" or ""water container empty"" even when there is water in it. See the video for proof. After about 10-15 attempt it works and makes a cup. Luckily it doesn't reject the pod and it can be reused (even though it doesn't really even use it). Note this doesn't happen every time and usually it is the 2nd cup of the day that we end up fighting with the machine on. The other major complaint I have about this machine is precisely the way it tells you the error code. There is no display which code show a code. In stead you have to watch the flashing light and count how many red or green lights flash and how long they stay eliminated. Then you have to use the manual to look up the red/green code. Why can't you just have a $2 display that shows the status of the machine...WOW! What century are we in...lets make the error code reading as complicated at we can that way the user has to guess at the actual problem. Come on nespresso! Even a $5 calculator has a digital display. OK, back to the issue. As you can see on the video there is water in the carafe yet the machine continue to through an error. We are getting more and more frustrated by the cup. I will leave the rating at 3 stars but only because the coffee is so damn good.... when it does create a cup full.

UPDATE 5/11/2019
Ok. Now we are going down to 1-star (from 3). The machine makes the first cup every morning just fine. The 2nd cup NEVER works. The ""refill water"" light flashing comes on after you press the button to start the 2nd cup. I called customer service at Amazon and because we are over the 30-day window (actually 35) Amazon won't take it back. They patch me into Nespresso hot-line and then Nespresso wants to troubleshoot the problem, all over again. After talking to two people at Nespresso and arguing over what the red flashing light means and actually reading the manual to the Nespresso person on the phone she finally agrees to ""repair"" the machine. At first she wanted to ONLY send an empty UPS box so the machine could be sent to be ""repaired by a technician"". She told me that process would take about 2-weeks. I told her that was unacceptable and I needed coffee. She reluctantly agreed to send a ""loaner"" machine that we could use while our machine is ""being repaired"". After an hour with her on the phone I was ready to give up. It was apparent she had a ""protocol"" that she had to follow in order to reduce the returns and get customers to give-up because their customer service process is too complicated or there is too much push-back from the representative. I'm overall very disappointed with Nespresso and wish I would have purchased the machine at the local target. At-least then I could just take it back or buy another one and then take this one back. Nespresso you need to whole-heartedly stand behind your product for greater than 35 days and not give your customers the run-around. Think about how many people I'm going to tell about my experience with your product and the poor customer service. Also, add a digital display to the machine, it can't cost more than a free calculator display. A real code to read instead of a flashing light to count flashes like morse code would REALLY help your customers AND your customer service representatives in troubleshooting the errors...DUHH!",미국에서 2022년 6월 24일에 검토됨

112,별 5개 중 5.0,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 그레이,"Just a week prior to this purchase I bought the original espresso only nespresso not realizing there was a version that brewed coffee. I quickly returned that purchase and bought the vertuoline.

There are two versions / manufacturers of the nespresso vertuoline--- 1) DeLonghi (this one) and 2) Breville. I chose the DeLonghi version exclusively for the swivel water tank feature. Aside from this functional difference they appear to be identical aside from design appearance. I'm really glad I went with this one as it really comes in handy having the tank on same side as sink. I've even moved the machine to opposite side and swiveled the tank to accommodate it.

Its important to note that this machine uses vertuoline size round pods ONLY. You cannot view the small espresso capsules. There is a line of espresso capsules that fit this machine however the selection is more limited than the original Nespresso line (it is however growing).

Before purchasing I read many reviews which mention a problem with the water temp being too cool. This comes down to preference- I would say this pumps out sufficiently hot coffee for my liking. I noticed the second consecutive cup brews a bit warmer than the first cup (maybe the machine warms up). Nespresso told us that you can prime the machine by brewing a cup of plain water first-- this hasn't been necessary -- my hubby prefers his coffee extra hot so I always brew my cup first and his second. He's had no complaints and doesn't need to microwave it for additional heat.

The frother is also great- Try using low fat or no fat milk for the best front. I tried half and half and it doesn't foam near as well. I wish the container had a lip to pour from but that's my only feedback.

I seen a Nespresso demo years ago at Target and I wish I had taken the leap sooner. In the bay area I had a daily Philz coffee 4$ day habit and I haven't been once since this purchase. My favorite capsule is the Giornio. Add a splash of heavy whipping cream for perfection. Brews with a beautiful foam on top. Perfection!",미국에서 2022년 5월 7일에 검토됨

121,별 5개 중 5.0,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 타이탄.,"This is a wonderful machine for a great coffee experience. The Nespresso brand coffee pods are high quality, flavorful, and there is enough variety available to suit every taste. I haven't found anything that I don't like about the machine. I purchased the one with the milk frother because that is something that I enjoy.

Some of the reviews stated that the coffee was not hot. With the frother, you can froth your milk or cream. If you don't like froth, I would just microwave my cream in the coffee cup to heat it a little before brewing the coffee or just microwave the cup for a few seconds to take the chill off.

The Nespresso recycling program is especially easy and attractive for the consumer. The pods, in which the coffee comes, are aluminum. The company supplies free recycling bags which are already prepared with shipping label and shipping fee. All you have to do is put the used pods in the supplied bag, close (bag is self sealing), and drop at UPS. Easy peasy. When you order your coffee pods, if you need recycling bags you add them to your shopping cart for free. I love how this company has made recycling of their product easy and seamless for the consumer.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018"

They want you to empty the pods each time. Don't leave them in the catch container, or they will drip.

EDIT: Flavors, oh man, you have to try the Caramelizio, Bianco Leggero (over milk) and the Bianco Forte (over milk)

Makes good coffee, I'm still searching for the perfect flavor, but the machine itself is a work of art. I love the mechanical head lifting and how it disposes of the used capsule to it's container held in the back. It's actually pretty high-tech, so if anything malfunctions, there is an easy way to reset it without issue.

Your machine may need to be reset to its factory settings, to correct the amount of water dispensed through your capsules. To return to factory settings, we recommend the following steps:

Tap the lever upward, to eject any used capsule from the capsule chamber, then tap the lever downward, to close the head of the machine.
Push the lever down for approximately 3 seconds, until the green light goes out, to turn off the machine.
Press and hold the coffee button and lever down, simultaneously, for approximately 3 seconds, until the light is steady orange, then release the lever.
Press the lever down 3 times. The light should start blinking quickly in a pattern of 3 blinks and a pause.
Once the blinking pattern is established, press and release the coffee button.
The light will blink 3 times slowly, to confirm the reset, then turn a steady green.",미국에서 2022년 4월 16일에 검토됨

First of all, there is one button, and one button only, that will flash to express what is happening. Fine, except there are about 40 different color/speed combinations and you need to figure out the difference between a fast blinking red light and a rapid blinking red light.
If you only want the same type of coffee every single day, this machine is perfect. There’s one button, and it’s easy and clean. However, if you ever want to switch the size of the cup you’re having or switch another function, it’s about an hour of clicking a single button, diagnosing a blinking light, and experimenting to see if you got it right.

137,별 5개 중 3.0,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 그레이,"Based on reviews, I expected to obtain a superior cup of coffee. (I had been buying Starbucks.) It takes a while to sort though all the flavors to find one that is acceptable, not necessarily better than other coffee brands. Additionally, you have to get used to foamy coffee, similar to a latte. If you put cream or milk in your coffee, the coffee temperature may be too cool. The directions indicate that you should put the milk in first and stir the mixture when ready. However, I still need to put the cup in the microwave for 20 seconds to obtain a hot cup of coffee. Finally, the cost of the pods is more than I expected. Each pod costs $1.00 +. There is also a difference in the amount of coffee provided per pod. Unfortunately, the flavor my husband likes only provides a half a cup of coffee. You have to consider the flavor as well as the size of the pod in making a selection. He also has to add sugar to improve the flavor, which he had not needed to do before. Therefore, the cost-value benefit of this system may be an issue depending on your coffee preferences. I found that there are just too many usage restrictions and adaptations. I suggest that you view the YouTube presentations before buying or using this coffee system for the first time. There is a link on the Nespresso website. The videos are very good and will help in understanding how this system works. Additionally, Nespresso's customer service and delivery system are excellent.

Since I’ve been using the machine and don’t want to deal with the hassle of returning it I’ll have to reach out to the seller to see if they will ship a whisk to me.

I first tried Nespresso at my friends and liked it but wanted a larger quantity than an espresso. I didn’t know that there are machines that brew larger quantities, 8oz and 14oz.

Yeah it’s not as cheap as brewing a cup of coffee but I wasn’t doing that either. Instead I was buying a cup every day at work for $2. So for me it’s cheaper.

I have to say the coffee is much better tasting than Keriug, not sure if I spelled that correctly, and Starbucks.

The machine is very easy to use. Push up on the lever to open, the motorized lid opens, drops the spent pod at the same time, install the new pod, press down on the lever to close, and push the button at top to start.

The milk frothier is extremely easy to use. Pour in the milk to one of the two fill lines, close and press the button. Since I only have the one whisk I’ve only filled it to the lower level and frothed hot milk for hot drinks. I haven’t used it yet, but if you press and hold the button for 2 seconds you can froth milk for cold drinks. Hot the button flashes red and cold it flashes blue. Pretty smart.

If you are considering this machine, what are you waiting for?

Update 12/17/17: The instructions are not the most detailed, but I did notice that the provided whisk can be converted by removing the spring. In the lid there is a spring storage bracket when you are using the whisk without the spring. Therefore, the package came complete and I’ve upgraded my rating to 5 stars.

The unit is much quieter than the Nespresso Pixie Espresso Maker I have and it heats up more quickly. For early morning use the Pixie is loud enough to wake up a light sleeper. That is not a worry with the new machine.

I like the option to make full size cups of coffee and the selection of pods that came with the machine was varied enough to help me find the flavors I enjoy best. I will keep using the Pixie for espresso until the Veturoline espresso sized pods find a lower price-per-cup.

I do think the price per Veturoline pod is high but that does not detract from the machine.

I have read some reviews about a problem with scaling. I only use distilled water in all of my coffee machines and although I have only had this machine for just over 5 months, I have used my 1st Nespresso machine almost daily for over 2 years and I have not experienced any scaling issues with it.

The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi is a good machine and with a fair price. It is easy to use and easy to clean and has a larger water reservoir than expected.

But no fix needed, my machine does not leak a bit.
I like Aflorazio cups made with stevia and Nutpods vanilla oat creamer (I have a different brand of frother that I had purchased before my Nespresso) - makes great latte!

Finally got one, and love it! I was a bit worried because apparently some of this line leak, but I have had zero problems with mine so far (I've had it about a week). I realized that because I usually make a morning latte that has two espresso shots in it (ie. two of the capsules) I would be better off with a machine that makes coffee too, so I got this one. I LOVE the coffee. Make no mistake: this machine is NOTHING like a keurig, and if you like keurig coffee, this is NOT for you. This machine makes strong, lucious coffee with crema on the top, which I love, and it also makes espresso. If you regularly go out for coffee at a place like Starbucks or somewhere else that makes fancy coffee drinks, you'll love this, but if you're after the kind of insipid drink that passes for coffee in a lot of the US, this will not be for you. I had given up on drinking drip coffee completely, because it's usually not strong/tasty enough for me, so I alternate between making a cold brew myself and this machine, and it keeps me going.

One small nitpick: I actually like the espresso from my old machine a bit more, because my old one had no auto-shut off, and I could adjust the strength of the espresso to my own purposes. I also prefer a bit less crema on my espresso than this makes. But it's a mild complaint.

Hopefully their patent expires and opens up more options eventually. A lot of reviews said the coffee maker was quiet, but i wouldn't call it that, you can definitely hear it and i would say that it's actually kind of loud. The milk frother is my favorite part - do not get the maker without the frother. Half and half works best, and it even heats up the creamer to a pretty hot temperature.

To me if you are questioning this machine and to a Keurig, just forget about the Keurig all together you'll be disappointed in the long run and will eventually buy a Nespresso machine.

Price break down for buying pods is $1.10 each when you buy 1 sleeve of 10 pods.

The coffee produced has a sort of espresso style crema which I did not know was a thing (I'm not a coffee snob, I just like a solid cup of coffee). Pictured is my likely mishandling of the aeroccino, still trying to figure out how to get maximum froth.

169,별 5개 중 5.0,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 그레이,"This is my first Nespresso Vertuoline machine and I love it. I got it on sale for $113 on Black Friday with the milk frother.

Let's start with the ease of use of this espresso machine. You press the top coffee button and the machine warms up, the green light becomes steady and it's ready to brew. Put in your favorite capsule and close the top lid and press the coffee button. Did I mention the motorized capsule lid? The lid opens and closes itself with a touch of the lever and disposes the capsules into its bin on the back of the machine.

Milk frother is even easier to use. Just pour the milk in and press the button. Adding the froth of milk makes you feel like a real barista! You can totally make the same exact drinks as they make at Starbucks for the fraction of the cost. And the drinks are super strong depending on which intensities you choose.

I paired this machine with double-walled coffee/espresso cups also purchased on Amazon. Much better than your everyday ceramic cups so you can see what you're drinking and the art you just created in the cups. I also purchased the storage drawer holder for capsules that stores the capsules and machine on top (see pics)!

This is like any other home appliance. You have to upkeep things like this. Clean it. Maintain it. If you don't do any of these things, things will eventually break. And for the people that gave this product 1 star, return it if it's broken?","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018"

That said - I could not recommend this product. I gave 2 stars because it's actually a good product when it actually works, but our 1st machine and 2nd machine both started to leak internally.

PROS:
Easy to use
Coffee is delicious
Good selection of flavors on nespresso.com
The coffee pods are recyclable; nepresso.com even sends you self-addressed envelops to send back the used pods, free of charge.

Note: I've never used or tasted a Keurig so I can't compare with other similar machines. I've had the a Mr. Coffee for the past 10 years and only switched to Nespresso after glowing reviews (and an Amazon sale).

CONS:
Leaks after a few months!!! Our 1st machine leaked, our 2nd (replacment) also leaked!

We've bought the Nespresso Virtuo Plus back in December 2019 since it was on sale on Amazon.
After about 3 weeks, it started leaking at the bottom. It seems like the there was a clog somewhere inside the machine so coffee would get backed up and overflow. We did the recommended cleanings and descaling cleanings as well, but that didn't help.

We did an exchange with Amazon and got the replacement end of January 2020. It was working beautifully, we did the recommended cleanings as per the manual's schedule. It started leaking as well in middle of May 2020,, same issue as the 1st machine.

Since it's still covered under warranty (1-year manufacturer warranty), we called Nespresso customer support and they walked us through some troubleshooting (use a toothpick to pick out clogs, do a clean cycle with hot water) but it still leaks, so they are sending us a box so we can send back the Vertuo Plus so they can fix it and send it back. We are potentially without coffee for about 3 weeks so we will be using Mr. Coffee in the meantime to fill the void.

Honestly we are expecting the 3rd machine to eventually break, which is a shame because this is a great machine when it works. It's hard to go back to Mr. Coffee that we are willing to put up with this product as long as the warranty covers replacements but I do not recommend this product.

I think alot of the positive reviews are from users who may not have come back to update their initial 4/5 star reviews.

188,별 5개 중 3.0,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 레드,"Good luck getting Vertuoline coffee anywhere else except Amazon. Your local big box stores don't carry it. What's Vertuoline coffee you ask? Well, it's these newer giant pods from Nespresso. When I bought this machine, I should have better educated myself, because these things are both rare and expensive comparably to K-Cups etc.

The good is that the coffee it does produce is excellent. Tastes good, high caffeine (if that's what you're into) and just works. It expels the pod neatly into it's little trash bin behind it, which is good for an office setting like ours. It also heats up relatively quickly compared to Kcup machines we've had in the past. It also uses aluminum pods, which for those BPA-phobic out there, I'm sure is a very good thing and perhaps worth the premium. Machine also looks good, is easy to clean, and works perhaps too simply, literally it's so simple that people get confused operating it.

The bad is expensive pods that are hard to find. Also we still haven't figured out how to get it to dispense just hot water for tea, hot cocoa, etc. When we do, it goes into ""cleaning"" mode and dispenses pretty much all the hot water.

Anyways, we got the machine on sale, it makes good tasting coffee so it's worth it for some. I wouldn't buy it again or necessarily recommend it for the simple reason you're locked into their rare Vertuo line crapola. If this somehow becomes as mainstream as Kcups, then cool, but I've seen no sign of that and quite honestly the opposite.

It's true the coffee is warm enough (if you want to drink it all immediately), but it's not hot! In other words, if you want to make your coffee, pour it in a to-go mug, load your things in the car and take the trash out, by the time you pull out of your driveway, you will need to drink your coffee all at once if you want it warm at all.

I tried a Keurig for awhile. It was pretty finicky. Finding a keurig that didn’t make coffee that tasted like burnt plastic wasn’t easy. I’ve had an older nespresso machine, and liked their espresso. Decided to finally try their newer combo machines. I’m very impressed. Very easy to use, and the coffee and espresso are very good. Lots of choices with regard to drink sizes and roast strength.

Some things to consider.....when you buy this machine, you must use nespresso capsules. Capsules are easy to get on Amazon, or you can order them directly from Nespresso. The cost per cup, compared to other methods of preparation, is high. To me, it’s worth it. Only you can make that decision for yourself.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018"

I have used keurig for years before this and I am disgusted in myself that I ever thought that was coffee.

269,별 5개 중 2.0,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 블랙,"This model has some annoying design flaws:

-- There is a variable delay after pressing the brew button without any visual indication that the button press got things started. So you're left wondering if you pressed the button hard enough, or maybe need to press it twice just in case.. until the coffee starts.

-- Sometimes the pods get stuck on the rails while sliding back into the pod container.

-- The pod container is solid black and can't see what's inside, until it's completely full and it is overflowing.

Now after about 6 months it started leaking somewhere internally and won't turn on anymore.

I see much better reviews on the older model Vertuo Evoluo (ENV135GY). That one has a transparent pod container on the side. I'm going to try that model as a replacement.

Nespresso needs to make better machines. Nespresso Vertuo produces a superior tasting coffee compared to Keurig, but unfortunately the new Keurig K-Supreme Plus blows this away in quality, features, and overall design.",미국에서 2022년 7월 28일에 검토됨

I appreciate that it automatically detects whatever type of pod is inserted and adjusts the water accordingly. The used pods are recyclable, so we just bag them up and send them back to the manufacturer (free postage), so this product generates no trash beyond the packaging it ships in. It’s easy to clean and maintain; we’ve had no problems in 8 months of daily use.

The pods cost about 85 cents each, which is a little more than the grounds for a conventional espresso machine, but it takes no time to prepare or clean up. We’re all busy, and no one wants to spend three minutes washing coffee grounds out of all the crevices of their machine.

Save your self the time and money. The expensive coffee machine gives you the feeling of making a better expresso coffee but you really aren't. Nespresso capsules are actually very fresh and sealed in aluminum for freshness so Dont mix it up with the k cups, which are in plastic. The freshness and the brew of this coffee maker is side by side with the $500+ coffee machines.

Except this is much easier and faster to use. They took a $500+ coffee machine, made it simple and faster to use with coffee ready to go in capsules with the perfect size of coffee printed on the barcode on the capsules themselves.

273,별 5개 중 1.0,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 그레이,"You have to ask yourself... Do you feel lucky? It seems that the seals on some of these that fit the top of the coffee pod randomly go hard and crack letting the coffee escape as the pod is spun. You'll know if you're one of the unlucky few if you start getting coffee down the back of the machine and all over your counter. If you're really unlucky like me, it will be just out of warranty and they'll want $125 to fix it or they'll give you a discount on a new one after accusing you of being the problem because you didn't clean the machine ONCE A WEEK. Who does that?. In any case, neither is really an acceptable solution to what is definitely a design flaw. My old Tossimo worked for 11 years and I only switched to this machine because I couldn't find the pods for that one anywhere anymore. So, my recommendation is to run in the other direction. Buy a different model, buy a Keurig, buy a drip coffee maker... Or if you're feeling lucky, roll the dice. I wish you luck!

Update: I liked the coffee enough that we rolled the dice and bought a new Virtuoline Next machine. This machine is engineered MUCH BETTER. They basically gave-up on trying to stop the system from leaking and just engineered the new machine to manage the leaks. Now, any leaking flows into a little cup under the spent pod storage. So, even if the machine leaks, at least it won't get all over your counter like the VirtuoPlus machines do. Basically, in my mind, this is an admission that the VirtuoPlus machines have a major leak issue, and their refusal to acknowledge this or address it a few months past the warranty is poor business. Run away from this particular model. Buy a VirtuoNext. You'll lose the motorized lid, but you won't miss it, and you'll save yourself a ton of mess and money when the machine inevitably starts leaking.",미국에서 2022년 3월 25일에 검토됨

But the BIGGEST ISSUE... It now leaks coffee out the back - not water, COFFEE! I have to stuff the machine with paper towels to keep the coffee from running all over my counter and it only brews about half of the cup - the rest spills out of the back into paper towels.

394,별 5개 중 1.0,스타일: 머신 + 에어로색상: 타이탄.,"It does a great job and the espresso and frother both work well ... BUT they charge you $1.10 per pod which is absolute extortion. I work from home and drink 3 - 5 cups per day Monday - Friday. So the simple math is that this coffee cost me between $780 - $1,300 per year based on 3 - 5 cups per day, with 260 workdays a year.

If you pay $400 more up-front for a real espresso machine with frother, the taste obviously won't be compromised. In fact, you will have a much wider variety of coffee selections and strength options available to you. But more importantly, the coffee will only cost you about $375 per year max for higher end coffee choices - and more cups in a day. So the higher costing machines pay for themselves well within a year, and then the savings goes on for all future years.

You can opt to use the $900+ per year savings on something far more intelligent. That is of course unless you actually like paying well over double what you should for the barely noticeable convenience of a pre-packed pod (takes me 30 seconds).

Our machine started leaking coffee down the back of the machine, into the used capsule container, initially hiding but ultimately creating a mess following every use.

Trying to get it fixed was, unfortunately, very challenging and still ongoing. Instead of making it fast and straightforward to provide a replacement, Nespresso has a Byzantine customer service process that requires calling in (long hold times, with no monitoring of email), and eventually led to Nespresso sending a box for shipping (1 week), agreeing to evaluate and attempt to repair it (4-6 weeks), and then either sending a repaired machine or replacement (additional 1 week).

For the price of these things, along with the ridiculous cost of the coffee, ABSOLUTELY not worth it.

I used the free sample capsules that it comes with. The first one I used was supposed to brew only 7.7 fl oz and I used a 14 oz cup. When it finished brewing the cup was overfilled and spilling everywhere. I didn't add anything to the cup before adding the espresso so I know that it brewed double the amount that it should have. It doesn't give me the option for choosing a brew size so I know I didn't pick the wrong capacity. I tried it again with a capsule that was meant to brew 2.7 fl oz and it filled a third of the same cup so I am left to believe it is my machine that is working incorrectly.

Some of the machine looked unused, but when I plugged it in and opened the top to see where the pod is kept there were coffee grains in the pod holder.

709,별 5개 중 1.0,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 그레이,"I've owned two of Nespresso's classic coffee machines. I like in particular the ability to use refillable coffee capsules, where I can use high quality expresso like Intelligensia's Black Cat beans. The Vertuo coffee system of Nespresso was supposed to be an improvement on the classic system. Our experience with this machine has been anything but positive. My guess is that Nespresso is trying to suppress the customization of capsules, and require that all capsules be purchased directly from Nespresso. So, the idea is that Nespresso uses centrifugal forces (high speed spinning) to extract coffee... brewing parameters are adjusted for each capsule, using the barcode data to regulate the flow and volume of water, as well as temperature, infusion time and capsule rotation speed, which is a process Nespresso says helps to produce a rich crema. In fact, this machine consistently produces bitter, foul coffee (but the crema looks good). Cleaning doesn't help, nor does any other adjustment documented in the manual. You can't buy refillable capsules that allow you to use your own coffee, either ... this is probably the main reason that Nespresso switched to the Vertuo system. The older classical system has become hard to find, which was a big reason for taking a gamble on their new Vertuo system.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018"

Well, I just made three cups, and every single cup came out what I would consider below lukewarm. I even microwaved my coffee mugs so they were piping hot, and frothed the creamer, and it did absolutely nothing. As for me and my household, we only do hot coffee, unless we are drinking iced. I will also note, that when I put the middle pod in, which is an Altissio, barely anything happened, a few drops of coffee came out, and that was it. I’m thinking I may have received a used, or broken machine as well. When I received my package, it looked like the box was worn, weathered, and previously opened. The frother also does not do a very good job of frothing. I have another frother from Espressotoria, and it’s amazing. So, there’s my eperience with Nespresso Vertuo Plus.

After 30 minutes of manipulating a toothpick, a toothbrush and warm sudsy water, we got nowhere. The final solution? Either send the $134.25 machine to get fixed for a fee of $125 or purchase a replacement machine at ""25% discount""--which, by the way, was the exact same price listed on Amazon.

After a time, by design, you will get an error indication that it's time to descale and shortly your machine will stop making coffee until you do. Chuck the Nespresso instructions and find a youtube video for your machine and follow along. There are only two controls, the cup button at the top and lever at the front. Sometimes you need to press them at the same time but other times separately. Sometimes you need to press the for a long (3s) time but other times just a tap. The machine state needs to be decoded from a multi-colored ring that blinks with different colors and different rates. If you are color-blind you may have a problem. My machine had been back to the company three times to be fixed before they gave me a new one with a shortened warranty. This required 4 or 5 phone calls of at least 30 minutes each. I've been using this machine for 18 months and still need to go to youtube to make it work sometimes. Also, don't stockpile a large number of pods because if you get frustrated and decide to trash the machine you could be stuck with hundreds of dollars of coffee pods you can't use.","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2017"

So far exceeds our expectations for coffee. It’s just so fresh and delicious and if you read about the science of why it’s really fascinating. Just order one and try it for yourself.

1529,별 5개 중 4.0,스타일: 기계 전용색상: 그레이,"First off, and most important, this makes amazingly good coffee. I am not an fancy coffee person, I don't do Starbucks or similar shops, I just like a good cup of coffee. And this definitely nails that.
The pods are pretty expensive, so this is not my everyday coffee but for a treat on weekends or special occasions only. If the pods were more readily available, and definitely if they were cheaper, I'd probably end up drinking it more often, but I've only been able to find them online so far, and there aren't any off brands yet.
My biggest issue with this machine is the lack of a low water light or something similar. When it runs out of water, it doesn't tell you. It will start making coffee and make only half of a pod because it ran out of the water. A few times this has happened I thought I put in an espresso pod which makes a much smaller cup. And of course once I opened up the machine and realized I put in a bigger pod, I can't use it again because it's poked so many holes in and the pod is pretty much wasted. Obviously I am working on remembering to check that every time before I turn it on, but that does not help my guests very much when they go to use it.
I also wish that the water reservoir was more firmly attached to the machine. It's great that you can position it to the back or the side, but it feels like if I am not super careful when I refill it, I could break it off from the actual machine. And, of course I want a bigger reservoir.
Overall, I love the coffee that this machine makes enough that I will continue using it, but I hope by the time I'm ready for a new one they have considered the design a bit more.",미국에서 2019년 11월 29일에 검토됨
